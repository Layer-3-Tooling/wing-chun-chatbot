<p>Becoming a Wing Chun practitioner is different for everyone. Some start to learn realistic self defense, some begin to get in better shape. Other&#8217;s a bit of both! Below is one&#8217;s students journey on why they started Wing Chun Kung Fu, and how training at <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/about-sifu-och-wing-chun/">Sifu Och Wing Chun</a> has impacted them:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-left is-style-default"><p>&#8220;<strong>Growing up I was raised in a harsh environment. &#8220;</strong></p><p>&#8220;The streets of New York showed and taught me a lot. I was only 5 years old when I got my first punch in the face. It is funny because I can still remember the whole situation quite vividly. I was going down a slide and thought everything was cool. There was a kid that was in front of me and once he got off the slide he turned around and hit me. </p><p>My mom did not raise me to be violent, so I started crying the moment his fist touched my face. My dad heard what happened and from there my Martial Arts career began. I was forced into a world that molded my character and played a significant role in the person I am today. I started with Karate and as time passed, I dabbled in other forms of combat like Boxing and different styles of Kung Fu.</p><p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1223" height="818" class="wp-image-11488" style="width: 700px;" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/04144625/IMG_7565.jpg" alt="sifu justin och training student in wing chun kung fu technique" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/04144625/IMG_7565.jpg 1223w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/04144625/IMG_7565-800x535.jpg 800w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/04144625/IMG_7565-768x514.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/04144625/IMG_7565-400x268.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/04144625/IMG_7565-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1223px) 100vw, 1223px" /><br><br>Every art form showed me different things that I can use to protect myself and my loved ones but out all of them <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/classes/lakeland-wing-chun-kung-fu-classes/">Wing Chun</a> is hands down my absolute favorite. <strong>I have finally begun an art that I will never stop doing.</strong></p><p>Wing Chun is something that runs in my family. My uncle and father trained together when I was younger but the Sifu did not allow kids to join the class because the training was too difficult. I used to hate the fact that I could not attend class but in time life went on. I have wanted to learn Wing Chun for years, but life just kept getting in the way. One day last year I decided that enough time had passed, and I needed to make this happen. I went online and did some research. I found Orlando Wing Chun/Sifu Och Wing Chun and read about the teacher and his teacher as well. I looked up the lineage of the school and did my best to get an understanding of what they were about. I was scared to join a school that was not authentic so I did my best to learn as much as I could. After my research was done, I reached out to the teacher via email and joined as soon as possible. My training has been nothing short of awesome. </p><p><img decoding="async" width="1162" height="818" class="wp-image-11489" style="width: 700px;" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/04144705/IMG_7574.jpg" alt="wing chun fitness student smiling at camera while in push up position on exercise mat" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/04144705/IMG_7574.jpg 1162w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/04144705/IMG_7574-800x563.jpg 800w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/04144705/IMG_7574-768x541.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/04144705/IMG_7574-400x282.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/04144705/IMG_7574-600x422.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1162px) 100vw, 1162px" /><br><br>My instructors have been patient, understanding and extremely helpful. They have also inspired me to teach others when I am ready in the future so I can give people the gift that I have been given. Wing Chun has given me a newfound confidence in my ability to quickly de-escalate a physical altercation with minimal damage to myself. I have learned different styles throughout the years, but nothing is like Wing Chun. It is direct, straightforward and effective. </p><p>I honestly believe anyone with the will to learn can develop the skills that Wing Chun has to offer. I highly recommend this art form to any and everyone who wishes to protect themselves and their families. In my eyes, Wing Chun has saved my life because I am now much more prepared for any situation that may be presented to me. Knowing that you can protect yourself and others is a feeling that is indescribable and worth more than any currency that exist in this world.<br><br>In conclusion, I am forever grateful for the skills I am learning every day at Sifu Och Wing Chun. It truly feels like a family that I will continue to grow with and love more every day. I will continue to do my best to honor the efforts of my Wing Chun family and strive for excellence with everything I have in me and more.&#8221;</p><p>– Ian H.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="font-weight: 400;">My First Year of Wing Chun: How I Earned My Orange Sash</h1>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As I reflect on my first year of Wing Chun, I’d like to start out by giving a sincere “thank you” to all of those who have trained with me, sparred with me, coached me, and inspired me along the way thus far. I would not be where I am today without all of you, and wanted to share my gratitude first and foremost before sharing the rest of my story of how I’ve grown as a martial artist and human being since I joined in March of last year.<a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/contact-sifu-och/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-9282" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/24104840/lakeland-martial-arts-5-classes-for-25-trial.gif" alt="trial, martial arts trial, martial arts lakeland, lakeland martial arts trial, " width="265" height="80"></a></p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">My Journey to Wing Chun</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/my-first-year-of-wing-chun-at-sifu-och-kung-fu/img_9853/" rel="attachment wp-att-9411"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-9411 alignright" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104912/IMG_9853-scaled.jpg" alt="lakeland, florida, sifu och wing chun, female wing chun, wing chun woman, wing chun woman punching, punch, " width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104912/IMG_9853-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104912/IMG_9853-800x533.jpg 800w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104912/IMG_9853-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104912/IMG_9853-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104912/IMG_9853-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104912/IMG_9853-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104912/IMG_9853-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104912/IMG_9853-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Growing up, I was a competitive gymnast, my mom was a professional water skier, and my dad regularly practiced Judo, a Japanese martial art. I watched him work persistently to get his black belt, while also coaching young students who admired him. He taught me how to kick and punch the heavy bag in our backyard when I was 2 years old, so I always had an interest in pursuing martial arts, but I did so many other competitive sports as a teenager instead. I was a born and bred athlete, and martial arts was in my blood. It was only a matter of time before I would find a passion for the sport because my dad lit the flame that burns within me today.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">I did alot of research&#8230; not all instructors or styles are equal</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/my-first-year-of-wing-chun-at-sifu-och-kung-fu/img_9857/" rel="attachment wp-att-9410"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9410" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104901/IMG_9857-scaled.jpg" alt="female wing chun fighter, wing chun fighter, woman fighter, wing chun fighter, woman, female" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104901/IMG_9857-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104901/IMG_9857-800x533.jpg 800w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104901/IMG_9857-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104901/IMG_9857-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104901/IMG_9857-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104901/IMG_9857-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104901/IMG_9857-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104901/IMG_9857-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Finally, after doing much research over the years on different styles of martial arts and weapons training that always intrigued me, I narrowed down my top 3 choices with Wing Chun being the first. I thought it was going to be a struggle to find a decent school in an area that wasn’t known for being one of the most urban cities in the state, but lo and behold, my Google search brought up a few <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/testimonials/lakeland-martial-art-studio-one-big-family/">Wing Chun studios</a> in Lakeland, so I dug a little deeper to find the best one.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/my-first-year-of-wing-chun-at-sifu-och-kung-fu/img_9842/" rel="attachment wp-att-9413"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9413" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104931/IMG_9842-scaled.jpg" alt="wing chun woman, wing chun female, female wing chun, woman wing chun, woman fighter, wing chun fighter" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104931/IMG_9842-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104931/IMG_9842-800x533.jpg 800w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104931/IMG_9842-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104931/IMG_9842-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104931/IMG_9842-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104931/IMG_9842-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104931/IMG_9842-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104931/IMG_9842-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>I was looking for a place that would feel like home with close friends that would become like family. I was looking for a place that was professional, would provide me with the best training, the best instruction, and that specializes in what they do. It was clear from the online presence of Sifu Och Wing Chun that I was already going in the right direction, so I called for some more information and before I knew it, I was scheduled to try it out. The best part? My dad was coming with me! We were excited, and the classes didn’t disappoint. The <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/testimonials/never-thought-anything-effective-previous-karate-martial-arts-training/">effectiveness</a> and real-world application that they teach is unlike anything else. That’s why I chose Wing Chun. With enough proper training and dedication, I knew that a twiggy, little girl like me would be able to learn to take down a bigger, stronger opponent quickly and completely. I’m not at that point yet, but I’m more prepared for an attack on the street today than I was a year ago. And each day that I train, I’m that much more prepared to defend myself if necessary.&nbsp;<a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/contact-sifu-och/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-9282" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/24104840/lakeland-martial-arts-5-classes-for-25-trial.gif" alt="trial, martial arts trial, martial arts lakeland, lakeland martial arts trial, " width="265" height="80"></a></p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Dangerously effective self defense</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/my-first-year-of-wing-chun-at-sifu-och-kung-fu/roundhouse/" rel="attachment wp-att-9415"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-9415 alignleft" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104951/roundhouse-scaled.jpg" alt="my first year of wing chun, first year, wing chun, kung fu, lakeland, florida, sifu och wing chun," width="300" height="136" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104951/roundhouse-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104951/roundhouse-800x363.jpg 800w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104951/roundhouse-1400x635.jpg 1400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104951/roundhouse-768x348.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104951/roundhouse-1536x697.jpg 1536w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104951/roundhouse-2048x929.jpg 2048w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104951/roundhouse-400x182.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104951/roundhouse-600x272.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/24104951/roundhouse-1900x862.jpg 1900w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t choose Wing Chun because it’s easy. It’s not. I didn’t choose Wing Chun because it looks cool. Most of the time, it doesn’t. To an untrained eye, it happens so fast that the bad guy is on the ground before he knows how he even got there. The reason I chose Wing Chun was not just for good friends and dangerously effective self-defense, but I chose it because I wanted to challenge myself to be disciplined doing something hard that I’ve always wanted to be great at.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">It has definitely been challenging, but I’m still doing it and love it!</h2>

I face and overcome challenges every day that make me a better martial artist and a better person, and it’s the biggest challenges that I’ve learned the most from. They’re the ones that I wasn’t expecting to have, and also the ones that are a true test of character. I have learned to fall in love with the process of doing a technique thousands of times to eventually see it come as a reaction in a <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/wing-chun-vs-tae-kwon-do/">sparring</a> session; I have learned (and am still learning) patience with my own training and patience with the training of other students; and I have learned the importance of, not only surrounding myself with people that support and uplift me, but proactively supporting and uplifting everyone else as well.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">face challenges every day</h2>

I learn, grow, change and become better at facing these challenges every day because that’s the journey I chose to take when I walked through the doors of Sifu Och Wing Chun. It’s been a year, and so far, this journey is just beginning. I don’t know where else it will take me or who will join me along the way, but I’m excited to keep learning, keep growing, and keep training!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hope to see you in class, I look forward to being your training partner!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many steps to Building a Fun Kung Fu Kids Class. You can vary teaching styles based on age, style of martial art, and size of the class. Regardless of these factors there are a few things you can do to make sure that you are running and fun and engaging kids program.&nbsp;These are some of the things we do at the Sifu Och Wing Chun and Just Dance Afterschool and Martial arts Programs.</p>
<h2>Building a Fun Kung Fu Kids Class</h2>
<h3>Discipline</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7996 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103932/Lakeland-Little-Lions-preschool-martial-arts-kickboxing-karate-kung-fu-ages-3-5-300x216.jpg" alt="Lakeland little lions kids preschool martial arts kickboxing karate kung fu ages 3 - 5 years old" width="300" height="216">The very first thing that you must have when running any kids program is a focus on discipline. When the class is smaller, under 15-20 students, it can be easy to slack off give them more leeway. However, if good discipline is not integrated early in the program it will be difficult to maintain that when the class gets closer to 25+. What you must feel is the class energy. If the kids are engaged, following instructions, working hard, there will obviously be a very good energy in the class.&nbsp;On the other hand, if there are children that are whispering to each other, spending too much time fixing a shoe or belt, etc. there will be a hiccups in flow of class. When you feel the flow of energy weakening you must change the class dynamic. But more on that later.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8732 size-medium" style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/24104418/IMG_4412-300x200.jpg" alt="Kids Kung Fu, Kids Martial Arts Classes, Kids Kung Fu, Kids Training Lakeland, Bully Defense" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/24104418/IMG_4412-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/24104418/IMG_4412-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/24104418/IMG_4412-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/24104418/IMG_4412-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/24104418/IMG_4412.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />One of the first tricks we to maintain class discipline and structure is using the word discipline itself. When one of our instructors calls &#8220;discipline&#8221; the entire class responds with &#8220;yes sir&#8221; and stands at perfect attention. To compliment that you must enforce this and any other rules without hesitation or exception.</p>
<p>When we call discipline if any child speaks, doesn&#8217;t stand up, or is distracting another student we address it immediately. We enforce this with burpees. To keep the group together we will tell the students to start the burpee by saying &#8220;down&#8221;. When we say &#8220;up&#8221; we have them stand back up in discipline and say &#8220;yes sir&#8221;. This is repeated as many times as necessary until the group is performing this quickly as a unit.</p>
<h3>Class Dynamic</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7235 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/24103317/kids-martial-arts-after-school-program-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu-300x216.jpg" alt="kids martial arts, afterschool, kids martial arts, martial arts afterschool, afterschool pickup" width="300" height="216">The next aspect we will discuss is the class dynamic. As mentioned earlier you need to feel the energy in class. If you have classes that include children as young as 5 years old you will find that they my struggle more so with paying attention. If you also have a larger class this problem is compounded. To help maintain a fun but focused atmosphere you have to be able to make adjustment quickly. By interchanging combos with a mini work out you can quickly re-engage those who may be distracted. Teaching a basic combo like Jab, uppercut, round house, can be either very fun, or very boring. If you mix it into a fun work out to get the student&#8217;s moving you lift the overall energy. For example: if we have the students run in place, switch to high knees, then immediately take a fighting stance. Quickly follow up with the combo two or three times. Then we have them isolate one or two of those techniques and repeat them. The go back to the high knees, or jumping jacks etc. By cycling through different mini workouts, techniques, and other options you can keep the class very exciting.</p>
<h3><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7972 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103915/Little-Lions-preschool-martial-arts-feature.jpg" alt="Little Lions preschool martial arts" width="300" height="172" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103915/Little-Lions-preschool-martial-arts-feature.jpg 850w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103915/Little-Lions-preschool-martial-arts-feature-800x458.jpg 800w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103915/Little-Lions-preschool-martial-arts-feature-768x440.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103915/Little-Lions-preschool-martial-arts-feature-400x229.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103915/Little-Lions-preschool-martial-arts-feature-600x344.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Fun</h3>
<p>The last thing is of course have fun with them. If you as the instructor have an upbeat excited attitude then the students will more than likely emulate that. By embracing your inner child you can usually find new and engaging ways to energize the class. Have fun, maintain discipline, and you will have quite a enjoyable kids class.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wing Chun is not the easiest martial art to teach. The techniques come from a philosophy and list of principles. Due to this, the application of the techniques can be done with many variations that can be considered &#8220;correct&#8221;. These variations can cause added frustration. This is due to the details when it comes to teaching the variations. So that being said, you need to give ample attention to your students to genuinely help them understand, learn, and apply their Wing Chun. Sifu Och&#8217;s three sections of teaching his main classes help accomplish that.</p>
<h2>Sifu Och&#8217;s Three Sections of Teaching</h2>
<h3>Beginner Class</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-9136 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/24104747/women-wing-chun-kung-fu-class-training-high-block-biu-sau-punch-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-florida-usa-300x200.jpg" alt="women wing chun, kung fu, women wing chun class, high block, biu sau, punch, wing chun kung fu, lakeland, florida, usa, women wing chun kung fu" width="300" height="200">The beginner class is for those students that are within their first year of training. We typically have one main instructor on the floor who has trained for at least 3 years. He or she helps the new student&#8217;s build their fundamentals. The focus of this section of class is to build their immediate ability to stop basic, common attacks. In our article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/when-to-teach-wooden-dummy-chi-sao/">When to Learn Chi Sao &amp; Wooden Dummy</a> we cover in more detail what our philosophy is for that class. We want to make sure that when a student leaves our doors the are able to hand dangerous situations as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Much like a building we must set the groundwork. Within someones first year of training we teach them the basics to a few things. First, we guide them through the basics of footwork. Second, while building their footwork we help them through the concepts of using two hands at the same time. Thirdly, we want to build an attacking mindset. Instead of being focused on the perfect counter, block, or defense, we want our students to build an immediate offensive mindset.</p>
<h3>Intermediate Class</h3>
<p><a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/sifu-ochs-three-sections-teaching/wing-chun-coach-training/" rel="attachment wp-att-9230"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-9230 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-scaled.jpg" alt="Coach Level Training, Wing Chun Combos, Wing Chun Timing" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-800x533.jpg 800w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>For our Intermediate class we move past our basic footwork and attacks and start building our combinations. After initial contact you must follow up to finish your opponent. Building on the foundation of attacks we begin to teach students how to effectively and efficiently follow up.</p>
<p>Not only do we build in the ability to follow up and finish an opponent we also begin to lean heavier into reaction training and sparring. There are three main stages of development which I go into more detail in my article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/the-3-training-cycles-of-martial-arts-tips-for-the-beginner/">Three Cycles of Martial Art Training</a>. The last of these stages is reaction which is the hardest to master. Speed, technique, power, all mean nothing if you do not have the correct timing.</p>
<p>Conner McGregor said &#8220;Precision beats power, and timing beats speed&#8221; in a post fight interview. You can take this one step further and say that without any form of timing you cannot fight. So you MUST develop your timing. Wing Chun is very effective when used properly. But due to many attacks being intercepts versus blocks, learning the timing can be tricky. You must devote consistent hard work in sparring and active attacker training.</p>
<h3>Advanced Class</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7095 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/24103144/Long-Pole-Weapon-Fighting-or-Dragon-Pole-300x200.jpg" alt="Wing Chun Long Pole, Weapons, Wing Chun Instructor" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/24103144/Long-Pole-Weapon-Fighting-or-Dragon-Pole-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/24103144/Long-Pole-Weapon-Fighting-or-Dragon-Pole-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/24103144/Long-Pole-Weapon-Fighting-or-Dragon-Pole-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/24103144/Long-Pole-Weapon-Fighting-or-Dragon-Pole-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/24103144/Long-Pole-Weapon-Fighting-or-Dragon-Pole.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>At our advance class level we begin the refinement of the techniques. We being teaching and using the Wooden Dummy at this level. Now that there has been years of using the Wing Chun shapes and applying them against pressure we can now upgrade them to the fullest level.</p>
<p>The Wooden Dummy training helps conditioning of the arms as well as tightening of form. Since the dummy does not hit back it serves no purpose other than that refinement of techniques. Spacing, shapes, rooting, all can be worked on using the dummy.</p>
<p>When at the advanced class we now also pass on the more traditional aspects of Wing Chun including Long Pole and Butterfly Swords. Wing Chun needs to stay applicable to the current martial arts you might run in to. However, you must keep your roots strong in the history of your training. Now that your training is coming full circle we finish the circle with advanced techniques and weapons.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learning martial arts is much like a knife. You will take your training through stages before you can use it. The two main stages involved are crafting the knife and sharpening the knife. When to Learn Wooden Dummy &amp; Chi Sau depends on your view point in regards to these stages. I will speak from the perspective that I was taught at Sifu Och Wing Chun. That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that it is the &#8220;correct&#8221; way, it is simply how we do it here.</p>
<h2>Knowing when to teach Wooden Dummy &amp; Chi Sau</h2>
<p>Stage 1 &#8211; The view point that is at Sifu Och Wing Chun is one based in immediate application. When a student walks into our door we want to teach them street applicable techniques as soon as possible. We have had multiple students come into our studio living in dangerous situations. Our first advice is always to get away from the situation or people causing the problems. But when it comes to the techniques we can&#8217;t teach them Chi Sau or Wooden Dummy because at that moment it is not applicable.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2561" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2561" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-2561 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/24102023/IMG_5447-300x200.jpg" alt="women's self defense in lakeland florida women self defense sifu justin och wing chun kung fu martial arts" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/24102023/IMG_5447-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/24102023/IMG_5447-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/24102023/IMG_5447-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/24102023/IMG_5447-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/24102023/IMG_5447.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2561" class="wp-caption-text">women&#8217;s self defense in lakeland florida women self defense sifu justin och wing chun kung fu martial arts</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>They must be able to deal with dangerous situations and attacks immediately. We want to equip them with a basic defense against hooks, hard straight punches, take-downs, pushes, grabs etc. Once they have an established based we want to add onto their skill by adding combinations, transitions, and working against and with weapons. Finally, free sparring to train you on how to use and deal with other martial arts combat reactions.</p>
<h2>The Need for Chi Sau</h2>
<p>Now, the argument might be made that without Chi Sau it will be difficult to enhance certain aspects of your reflexes. To this I agree to a point. In Chi Sau you deal with close quarter sensitivity reaction as well as redirection and close range trapping. So it is a vital aspect of training Wing Chun.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-4181 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24102505/lakeland-fl-self-defense-lakeland-fl1-300x182-300x182.jpg" alt="wing chun classes" width="300" height="182">However, for the new student, Chi Sau may be difficult to use as a tool. You must train Chi Sau to learn structure before using it for reaction. Making sure that you have constant forward energy, balanced strength, and good relaxation can takes weeks to months of hard training.To fill in the gab between sparring and Chi Sau we use wrist against. This is essentially Chi Sau reaction hands without the rolling.</p>
<p>The same is essentially true with the wooden dummy. But instead of referring to reaction the wooden dummy would deal with structure and positioning refinement.</p>
<p>Stage 2</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7055 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/24103123/grandmaster-ip-chun-eldest-son-of-ip-man-sifu-justin-och-hong-kong-china-300x216.jpg" alt="grandmaster ip chun, Ip Chun, eldest son of ip man, ip man, sifu justin och, hong kong china" width="300" height="216">Stage 2 can be equated to the sharpening of the knife. You now have a good solid foundation in your techniques. You know how to apply them and it what situation they should be used. Now we must work to make them stronger, easier, more efficient. This is the perfect place for Chi Sau and Wooden Dummy. With the correct context in mind when applying the techniques, the refinement of them now has a purpose.</p>
<h3>The Knife</h3>
<p>Reverting back to the knife analogy. Imagine having a slab of metal and sharpening one side of it. Now, what do you have? A slab of metal with a sharp end. There is no way to use it as desired. Building the knife takes time. The handle, the guard if wanted, the length. You must make this part of the knife first before you can sharpen it. If you do not you are not only going to have a much hard time sharpening it but you will have an unusable knife.</p>
<p>Now, this goes without saying, all of the above depends on your goals. If you are seeking to learn Wing Chun to find balance in your life. Develop your mind and find new friends, then learning these aspects of Wing Chun sooner than later makes sense. However, if you are looking for the combat of Wing Chun then saving that for later is suggested for When to Learn Wooden Dummy &amp; Chi Sau.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Intercepting is always better than blocking. We are going to look at what the definition of intercepting is before we give some practical ways of accomplishing that. Webster&#8217;s dictionary defines intercepting as &#8220;to stop, seize, or&nbsp;<a class="mw_t_a_link" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/interrupt">interrupt</a>&nbsp;in progress or course or before arrival&#8221;. The best way to view intercepting is that last part of the definition, &#8220;interrupt&#8221;. Not only is the attack itself being interrupted, but the timing of your opponent should be as well. And that is the key, the timing. When timed properly your opponents attack will be nullified and you will be primed to launch a second attack (in theory before his second) or you would have already hit him. Now that we have addressed what intercepting as a concept let me provide you with&nbsp;4 Ways to Intercept your opponents attacks using Wing Chun.</p>
<h2>4 Ways to Intercept</h2>
<h3>Intercepting Fist</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_9018" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9018" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-9018 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104722/25625458_10214390795338812_1361328337_o-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104722/25625458_10214390795338812_1361328337_o-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104722/25625458_10214390795338812_1361328337_o-768x576.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104722/25625458_10214390795338812_1361328337_o-400x300.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104722/25625458_10214390795338812_1361328337_o-600x450.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104722/25625458_10214390795338812_1361328337_o.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9018" class="wp-caption-text">Intercepting Fist</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em;">The first technique we will go over is the Intercepting Fist. Made famous by Bruce Lee, this technique is typically taught fairly early on in student&#8217;s training. The idea is to counter the opponents punch with a punch of your own. By keeping your elbow down and pressing from center mass you are elbow to offset your opponents strike. This can quickly be follow up a flurry of punches we refer to as Chain Punches. Keeping the strikes down the center you are able to maintain control of your centerline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em;">When you substitute a Paak Sao with an intercept you will find it can be much easier to deal with a second and third punch. Part of this is due to the fact that you are returning the opponents punch with a punch. They will be slightly less confident with their next punch as opposed to when you simple deflect their initial punch with a Paak. Second to that, the Intercept automatically covers your opposite side incase of a second attack. Whereas the Paak leaves you more open.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>Turning Punch</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_9025" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9025" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-9025 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104726/Wing-Chun-Turning-Punch-intercepting-Fist-power-punch-scaled.jpg" alt="Wing Chun, Wing Chun Turning Punch, intercepting Fist, wing chun knockout punch, power punch" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104726/Wing-Chun-Turning-Punch-intercepting-Fist-power-punch-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104726/Wing-Chun-Turning-Punch-intercepting-Fist-power-punch-800x601.jpg 800w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104726/Wing-Chun-Turning-Punch-intercepting-Fist-power-punch-1400x1052.jpg 1400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104726/Wing-Chun-Turning-Punch-intercepting-Fist-power-punch-768x577.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104726/Wing-Chun-Turning-Punch-intercepting-Fist-power-punch-1536x1154.jpg 1536w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104726/Wing-Chun-Turning-Punch-intercepting-Fist-power-punch-2048x1539.jpg 2048w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104726/Wing-Chun-Turning-Punch-intercepting-Fist-power-punch-400x301.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104726/Wing-Chun-Turning-Punch-intercepting-Fist-power-punch-600x451.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9025" class="wp-caption-text">Turning Punch</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The Turning Punch basically the other side of the same coin referring to the Intercepting punch. The Intercepting fist is typically used to refer to the lead hand being used with the lead foot to interrupt the opponent. This is illustrated in the first photo above.</p>
<p>Turning punch is simply using the the same structure but opposite hand to accomplish the same goal. Since the punch is coming from the back foot, the turning punch will have more power and torque then the straight Intercepting. However, much like the Paak punch, if not used properly, can leave you open on the inside for an attack.</p>

<p>The Tan Sao is a very effective and sound way to intercept a strike. You have not only nullified the attack but you have also almost guaranteed a strike of your own. Tan and the actual punch are the exact same shape. The only exception is what the hand is doing at the end. You can see here in the photo the Tan Sao is an hand open towards the ceiling. By opening the hand the focus of the technique is diverted to the elbow. The Punch itself can be delivered to the head, or for a taller opponent you can strike the ribs.</p>
<p>Since the Tan extending through the strike towards your opponent, it makes stopping a second strike fairly straight forward. You can transition to a Paak Punch if the Strike is down the center. Or, you can continue pressing forward with a Bui Sao against a hook punch.</p>
<h3>Paak Punch</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_8427" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8427" style="width: 197px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-8427" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104146/17901892_10212042861041922_1811866813_o-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="197" height="262" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104146/17901892_10212042861041922_1811866813_o-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104146/17901892_10212042861041922_1811866813_o-400x533.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104146/17901892_10212042861041922_1811866813_o-768x1025.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104146/17901892_10212042861041922_1811866813_o-450x600.jpg 450w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104146/17901892_10212042861041922_1811866813_o.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 197px) 100vw, 197px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8427" class="wp-caption-text">Paak Punch, Kick</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Our last technique for this article on intercepting attacks is the Paak Punch. Clearing the attackers hit with Paak good, but combining it with straight punch is better. Since the Paak is coming off of the back foot there is a lot of power and structure with this counter. The Paak is also quite diverse.</p>
<p>When used, you can use the Paak to press forward and crush the attackers structure. You can guide his hand downward if he is taller. You can also use it to setup a baiting for the second punch.</p>
<p>Bonus: The Paak Punch is also a great attack to throw in a kick along with it. By doing this you maximize Wing Chun&#8217;s ability to use multiple weapons at once. You can see here in the photo, Sifu Justin used the Paak, Punch, and Kick. He uses the kick just before the punch clears the arm to finish the attack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>When it comes to Intercepting timing is everything. You can have GREAT structure, technique, and power. But, if you do not practicing your techniques in LIVE sparring scenarios you will get hit no matter how good you think you are. There is no substitute for hard work, and good punches to the face. Train hard and never give up.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Afterschool Kung Fu Fun is an overview article about how to enjoy teaching your afterschool kids martial arts class. Take a look!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to teaching children anything it can be either a complete drag, or the most fun you will have the whole day. Your attitude will determine whether or not the clock will slowly inch it&#8217;s way to the next minute or run out before you realize class is done. I will explain here in Afterschool Kung Fu Fun the three &#8216;E&#8217;s&nbsp; to actually enjoy teaching a kids class no matter the age.</p>
<h2>Afterschool Kung Fu Fun</h2>
<h3>Establish Discipline</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7990 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103920/Lakeland-preschool-little-kids-martial-arts-kickboxing-karate-kung-fu-dad-and-me-300x216.jpg" alt="Lakeland little lions kids preschool martial arts kickboxing karate kung fu ages 3 - 5 years old" width="300" height="216">The first thing that must be done is to establish a line of discipline with the student&#8217;s. Without discipline there will be utter chaos in the class. No matter how fun the class is there will always be some sort of disruption. In my article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/afterschool-martial-arts-showing-you-care/">Afterschool Martial Arts: Showing You Care</a> I explain in details a few details about establishing discipline. Understanding the line between fear and respect is crucial. Contrary to belief you cannot force someone to respect you. You can make them act a certain which may be perceived as respect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Respect is only achieved when the student&#8217;s know that you truly care about them. &#8220;People don&#8217;t care how much you know, until they know how much you care.&#8221; This is a phrase I live by. Before class starts I try to speak to as many of them as possible. I can build individual relationships with them and they can connect with me. We build trust and respect this way.</p>
<h3>Embrace Your Inner Kid</h3>
<p>Once you have established your discipline your class will go much smoother than without. A focused energy rises in the class when discipline is held across the room. You must capitalize on this energy. To use it you must embrace your inner child. If your 12 year old self were to be in this class what would make it fun? Answer that question over and over and you will find you are making new and exciting ways to do drills. You will find yourself looking forward to class. It becomes a chance to really have fun with your class.</p>
<p>By &#8220;becoming a kid&#8221; again you&#8217;ll see that you have the ability to take the same workouts and put a new spin one them that the kids will love. A perfect example is around Christmas time. At Sifu Och Wing Chun we have the kids to military crawl for part of the warm. The spin I tell them is that they are the Grinch and they have to sneak through the house without getting caught. Another fun warm up spin is something I call &#8220;ninja mode&#8221;. The students pretend to be ninjas while I give them instructions. Whether it is running quietly or jumping to avoid the incoming &#8220;sword&#8221;. They are able to get a good workout hidden under the guise of pretend.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7211 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/24103305/lakeland-kids-martial-arts-classes-afterschool-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu-300x216.jpg" alt="lakeland kids martial arts, martial arts, kids, martial art kids, kids classes, kids martial arts, lakeland, florida, fl" width="300" height="216"></p>
<h3>Explain Quickly</h3>
<p>The last thing that must be done is crucial. You must learn to be efficient with your explanations. Since their young minds have trouble focusing you must be potent with your talks. Clear and concise are your best friends. If you are able to explain techniques quickly you can spend more time drilling, working on their focus and persistence. Long explanations can also wear them out. While you don&#8217;t want to skimp on good info you have to find the balance or their little legs won&#8217;t be able to handle standing still for too long.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>To wrap things up. Three keys to having a good kids class: Establish discipline, Embrace your inner kid, and Explain quickly. If you can put all of these things together you will really enjoy teaching your kids class no matter the age.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The Strength of My Wing Chun is the Story of Ryan Beck and his training at Tampa Wing Chun. Read to see how he has grown and will never stop Wing Chun.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en"><u><b>The Strength of My Wing Chun: By Ryan Beck<br />
</b></u></span></span></span></h1>
<p>Wing Chun is different for each practitioner: how they move, when they flow and even the strength used. Each person is trained and trains differently; they all have different weaknesses and advantages. There are skills we all must learn and others that must be figured out individually. These gains can come fast while others take years to achieve. After approximately three years, I have seen these gains made by myself and others.</p>
<h2>My Wing Chun Start</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8965 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104639/Ryan-Beck-300x166.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="166" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104639/Ryan-Beck-300x166.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104639/Ryan-Beck-768x424.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104639/Ryan-Beck-400x221.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104639/Ryan-Beck-600x332.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104639/Ryan-Beck.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />When I first started training with Sihing Garret in Tampa, I was the only regular student. His boxing background, plus his time training in Wing Chun really set his skills apart. After the first class, I told myself, that no matter what, I would commit to training for at least one year, at that point I would re-evaluate. Not even two months later, I came to the realization that Wing Chun was in my soul and I was hooked.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en">With any form of martial arts, there are typically two types of gains: physical and mental. Physical goals are the easiest to see. I noticed I was moving faster, able to go longer, and could even tell my eyes where processing information faster. Slowly, was becoming a better fighter. I believe this primarily has to do with my instruction, training and dedication. These physical gains are generally noticed fairly consistently by all. You get out what you put in. These are the gains that pushed me through my first year.</span></span></span></p>
<h2>Wing Chun Year Two</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en">When my one-year marker hit, I looked back on all the gains I had made. The surprising part about this reflection was the mental and lifestyle achievements. These types of gains are much harder to identify. I saw my temper cooled, I was eating healthy and living a healthy lifestyle. The craziest part was that these changes, these gains started to become evident, when I saw the people around me changing as well. They were growing through my growth. My wife and our two daughters started eating healthier, drinking water and working out. In addition, my wife and our girls are on their own martial arts adventure too.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8964 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104637/Ryan-Beck-2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104637/Ryan-Beck-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104637/Ryan-Beck-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104637/Ryan-Beck-2-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104637/Ryan-Beck-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104637/Ryan-Beck-2.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The only limitation Wing Chun has to personal growth, is people’s willingness to grow. It’s not always easy to train. Let’s be honest, it’s hard work. After a long and hot day at my job, I don’t always want to train. We can always find a reason. I will never forget my Sifu once said, “instead of an excuse, just say it’s not a priority.” This is something I strive to apply to all aspects of my life. The interesting part is that once I am at class, I am always glad that I went. This is true in life, it’s never as bad as we thought it was going to be.</span></span></span></p>
<h2>Wing Chun For Life</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en">Over the course of my Wing Chun journey thus far, I have found three strong reasons why I will never quit Wing Chun. The first reason is my family, I see the change in them and they look to me for guidance in life. Without martial arts, I am not sure I would know what direction to take them. The second reason is the tradition and culture, I have always been interested in the history and where Wing Chun comes from &#8211; not only the fighting, but the lifestyle as well.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en"> There is such a history, that every time I Chi Sao, I feel like I am a part of something bigger than myself. The third and final reason I will never quit Wing Chun is the personal and physical aspect. I have grown tremendously since starting Wing Chun. The best part is how much growing I still have left to do. I know I can be faster, I know I can be even more technical and I know I have a lot more to learn and for me this is exciting!</span></span></span></p>
<h2>Your Wing Chun Journey</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en">Gains can always be made in Wing Chun as long as goals are being set and matched, as long as a person is dedicated to train and as long as the community is strong. Wing Chun is limitless! If I can train hard even when I don’t want to or kick open new doors when I am too tired to, then there is nothing I can’t do, in life or in Wing Chun.</span></span></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this Article: &#8220;A Letter To Myself-Marcus Morales&#8221;, Marcus tells us his story of how he started his Wing Chun Training. We hope you enjoy this little story!</p>
<h2>A Letter To Myself-Marcus Morales</h2>
<p>Do you know the feeling you get when you are about to do something and you do not know what the outcome is going to be? It happens all the time. For example, imagine it is the middle of summer, you are at the local pool cooling off along with a bunch of other people, and suddenly you decide you want to dive off the platform and continue to develop your patented cannonball dive. There you go, walking past everyone and you climb to the first level.</p>
<p>But, You realize that there are steps that will take you to the second tier and you follow them up another level.Then you see there is yet another set up steps and they take you to the very top platform. Somehow, you have managed to get up there, where no one else dares to go. There you are, standing at the highest level at the public pool with your lucky red bathing trunks. The ones with yellow rubber duckies on them. You look down and see that you are on the edge, staring at the crystalline blue water, deciding whether or not to jump.</p>
<h3>The Jump</h3>
<p>That is exactly how I felt when I was standing outside the door of Sifu Justin Och&#8217;s Martial Arts school. I was standing there, watching everyone doing all kinds of crazy things. Trying to decide whether to step inside or just keep walking. I must confess that I only knew a little about Wing Chun. I consider myself to be a bit of a tough guy; grew up in some tough neighbor hoods. I also served my country for six years and finished my obligation with an honorable discharge. During that time I even came back from a major injury in the Army. Suffice it to say, I thought I was tough enough. But something kept urging me to step inside, so I did.</p>
<h3>In the Water</h3>

I stood there, at that ceramic tile square at the entrance to the school. And the, Sifu came along and welcomed me in. He was not what I expected. Truth is&#8230;I didn&#8217;t know what to expect. But he walked up to me, with a thousand-watt smile on his face, and made me feel right at home. I didn&#8217;t know this until later, but he had just finished wrestling on the floor with some of his students.</p>
<p>One more thing I did not expect. I was still a little defensive, mostly because I didn&#8217;t know much about how things worked. All Sifu did was invite me to join in on the class he was conducting and then he would get back to me to see whether I wanted to be a part of it, so I accepted the invitation. I have not left the school since.</p>
<h3>Learning How to Swim</h3>
<p>From the very First minute you become a part of the school&#8217;s family and its culture. I was automatically being grabbed and tossed. I even received a stiff punch to the face, and just like that I was absolutely drawn to the scene. Somehow, despite all the punches and tosses, the sore bones and sprains, I have become more and more involved in the art. Sifu is there, with a smile on his face, teaching you everything you need to know about the art. And this is not a man who is boastful or driven by a sense of superiority. No&#8230; this man truly loves to tach, he wholeheartedly love the art, and he absolutely enjoys his students.</p>
<h3>Sifu Och</h3>
<p>One other thing that Sifu Och strives for at his school is the development of a community within the school. He is constantly coming up with events for the school, activities designed to strengthen the camaraderie within the student, to help foster positive relationships between the students, ones that they can potentially carry along wit them throughout their lives. I have come to believe that his desire to develop and nurture these positive relationships is at the core of the most successful martial arts school. Creating bonds not only between student and teacher, but between students, strengthens the school itself.</p>

<h3>Sifu&#8217;s Students</h3>
<p>The students at the school are without a doubt the greatest assets Sifu has at his disposal. From the Green Sashes all the way to his instructor level students. They understand Sifu&#8217;s philosophy when it comes to helping everyone who start training. They</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sal Ficaro came to Sifu Och Wing Chun about one year ago. He tried one of our classes and got very frustrated with himself and decided to leave. Sifu Och was able to talk to him and arrange for private lessons instead to help him through those first steps of learning. When I took on Sal and his private lessons I knew this would be a difficult task. Sal was not used to Wing Chun and it&#8217;s movements. However, I knew that it could be done because Sal had the right mindset. In this article, Sal Ficaro: Ageless Training, Sal will tell a little bit about himself and his training here.</p>
<h2>Sal Ficaro: Ageless Training</h2>
<p>&#8220;Hello, my name Salvatore Ficarro I am 58 years old. I&#8217;ve been training at Sifu Och Wing Chun it&#8217;s been a learning process. Timothy Kittelstad is one of the trainers at this studio and he is absolutely wonderful. Even though the journey has been tough I absolutely love it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8987 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104652/24139787_10214181889196289_1952524341_o-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104652/24139787_10214181889196289_1952524341_o-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104652/24139787_10214181889196289_1952524341_o-400x533.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104652/24139787_10214181889196289_1952524341_o-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104652/24139787_10214181889196289_1952524341_o-450x600.jpg 450w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104652/24139787_10214181889196289_1952524341_o.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />If anybody is in the 40s or 50s age and would like to learn some self-defense they should not hesitate. They should come down to Sifu Och and start their own journey! Your age shouldn&#8217;t hold you back. I&#8217;m 58 but that is just a number. I don&#8217;t allow that to be an excuse to not learn something new. Life can be very hard. And many times you want to just give up. But the wonderful things in life take some time to learn.</p>
<p>When you are working hard to learn something you may fall a little short. And when that happens, as long as you get back up and come back stronger that day was a success. There are days I feel I&#8217;m only at maybe 60% where I should be. But if I leave at 61% that means I am improving. Then next time maybe I&#8217;m at 70% or 80%. As long as you work hard and improve, no matter how small the improvement, you will always be able to grow. The staff at Sifu Och Wing Chun are the best trainers I&#8217;ve ever seen. They are their to help you. All they want is for you to be your best. And I want you to succeed. I feel if you give it a try your will fall in love with it.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Age doesn&#8217;t Stop Hard work</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8984 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104644/24008242_10214181889076286_390539567_o-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104644/24008242_10214181889076286_390539567_o-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104644/24008242_10214181889076286_390539567_o-400x533.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104644/24008242_10214181889076286_390539567_o-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104644/24008242_10214181889076286_390539567_o-450x600.jpg 450w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104644/24008242_10214181889076286_390539567_o.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />Sal shows that now matter your age you can accomplish anything with hard. Day after day Sal comes into class and puts in a hard days training. Starting from private lessons he has been able to work himself into the group classes. The most impressive thing about Sal is his determination. He doesn&#8217;t care about belts, or awards, or flashy techniques. He simply wants to know that he can take care of himself. Each day he comes in and builds himself from the last class.</p>
<p>Age is just a number. Everybody has hurdles they have to learn to overcome. Everyone has their own life story. Once you learn to accept your story and do the best you can with what you have you can start to really learn new things.</p>
<p>Instead of complaining about his age, or &#8220;not being able to move like he used to&#8221;, Sal trains his body to move the best it can right now. Because that&#8217;s what matters, the now. Not the past, not the future, but right now. What are you doing right now to make a difference in your life? If nothing than you should find the reason why. And then find a strong reason why you need to change that. Sal is a great example of someone who tackles life no matter what happens.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>My Journey Toward Wing Chun is Najai's story from Taekwondo to Wing Chun. It outlines his first exposure to Wing Chun as well as overcoming a tragedy. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>My Journey Toward Wing Chun</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: #454545;">My martial arts training started late in 2006 at Dan Parrish’s Taekwondo school.&nbsp; The sole purpose of me training there was for it to be an outlet for my anger issues. When my training first started, my attitude toward others, school, and life in general was horrible. At the same time that I was practicing Martial Arts, I was also regularly seeing a “Guidance counselor“ . With the help of my “guidance counselor“, my instructors at my Martial Arts school, and my parents… I was able to reduce the amount of anger I’ve always had and calm down as much as possible. </span></span></p>
<h2>Introduction to Ip Man</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: #454545;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7422 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/24103536/ving-tsun-history-1-300x216.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="216">As years went on I became a black belt at the same martial arts school but under a different instructor who’s name is Master Gary Hernandez. Around that time is when I watched the first Ip man movie. That’s when I wanted to start to learn any new style of Kung Fu, but Wing Chun in particular. Something terrible occurred I was working towards my 2nd degree black belt. A near fatal incident happened to my mother and now ex-stepfather.&nbsp; Once that happened, my training drastically went downhill. I wasn’t wanting to throw a single punch or block a single strike.<br />
</span></span></p>
<h2>Re-Focusing</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: #454545;">After a while, when I knew my mother would be OK I began to start training again. But this time I was traveling with a friend every Thursday and Saturday to Zephyrhills to continue my training. I was also training and teaching as one of the head instructors at my Lakeland taekwondo school. As 2014 was coming to A conclusion, my taekwondo school and Lakeland shut down because of financial issues which allowed me to become A full fledged student under Gary Hernandez. Once I became a student under Gary Hernandez I started training in the super foot system and earned my 2nd degree black belt<i>.&nbsp; </i>Soon after I received my next rank, I moved further away to the city of Winter Haven which kept me from training because of transportation issues.</span></span></p>
<h2>Lakeland Wing Chun</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: #454545;"> Fast forward towards 2016, I stumbled across the Wing Chun school in Lakeland. At the time I was very hesitant about walking in and asking questions because of the simple fact that I did not know how I would be able to make it to classes without there being A problem. I am glad to say that I do not regret walking into the front door. I met both the manager, Timothy Kittelstad, and the owner, Sifu Justin Och<i>.&nbsp;</i>They immediately made me feel welcome. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: #454545;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8786 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/24104441/Sifu-Justin-Och-Ip-Chun-son-of-Ip-Man-vtaa-300x216.jpg" alt="sifu justin och, ip chun, hong kong, florida, son of ip man, master" width="300" height="216">One of the many reasons why I love to train at this particular school is because of the authenticity of the Wing Chun that is being taught. There’s no place else like it, and there’s no other place that you can learn wing Chun from one person that’s been certified under multiple lineages. So far what I’ve gained and hope to continue gaining is the realness of Wing Chun and how the principles of Wing Chun affect more than just a persons martial art aspect<i>,&nbsp; </i>but also different aspects of every day life and activities. I’ve also learned and have gained many different techniques that is and will be always important to any true martial artist. </span></span></p>
<h2>Wing Chun&#8217;s Greatness</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: #454545;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8951 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104629/Naj-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104629/Naj-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104629/Naj-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104629/Naj-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104629/Naj-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104629/Naj.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Lastly, one thing I’ve gained since I’ve signed up at Sifu Och’s Wing Chun is the love and care that he provides and all of his students. Anyone who signs up will be able to experience the greatness and directness and effectiveness of Wing Chun. They will also be able to see how family oriented the school and the atmosphere is. They will also how hard and dedicated all the students are to their training.</span></span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Comparing martial arts has been happening for ages. It has it&#8217;s benefits but if not done with respect it has it&#8217;s pitfalls. Before I get into my article I want to clarify this article is a technical analysis of the two styles. It is not designed to bash either still but to show how one style would deal with the other. Wing Chun Vs. Tae Kwon Do is a hot topic because of how wide spread Tae Kwon Do is and the rising popularity of Wing Chun. &nbsp;This article will hopefully give some insight into the two styles if someone is looking to train in one of them.</p>
<h2>My Wing Chun Vs. Tae Kwon Do</h2>
<p>Having started in Tae Kwon Do and now studying Wing Chun I use both in my training. Wing Chun is used as my primary art which I train against other ex Tae Kwon Do practitioners. I then return the favor as the “bad guy” helping my Wing Chun family against my Tae Kwon Do. Needless to say I have much experience using the two arts against each other. I will first address using my Wing Chun against Tae Kwon Do.</p>
<p>Wing Chun seeks to destroy the enemy as quickly as possible. Using structure and an overwhelming wave of attacks the aim to not give your opponent a chance. But to be maximized it must close the distance and keep it closed. Trapping can be utilized, which to someone who doesn&#8217;t grapple or know any counters, can be detrimental. The issue can be found in closing that distance. One of the most useful tools I employ is making sure I attack with at least two weapons.</p>
<h3>Entry</h3>
<p>Kicking while either blocking or intercepting an attack is a favorite. With my the Wing Chun structure keeping both hands and at least one foot in range allows me to hit multiple points at once. This disrupts most peoples timing. This also serves to slow down my opponent if he is very mobile. A stomping kick (or what we refer to as a Shadow Kick) to the thigh usually does the trick.</p>
<h3>Understanding the Opponent</h3>
<p>A Tae Kwon Do fighter will try to use his reach and distance. Switching kicks quickly can be tricky to deal with. However, if directness is maintained it won&#8217;t be a problem. Front kicks can be dealt with by using a Bui Ma step with a Gan Punch to clear the kick. A back up option is simply dropping the lead elbow on the ankle of the opponent. Round houses are usually stopped using a Double Jum Sao followed up with a back fist or chop. Because of the structure of Wing Chun once the distance is closed the opponent usually doesn&#8217;t have much of a response.</p>

<h2>My Tae Kwon Do Vs. Wing Chun</h2>
<p>When fighting another Wing Chun student the hardest part, as mentioned above, is the directness.<br />
I must keep my distance and rely on speed, fakes, and mis-directions to even come close to landing a good strike. Using my lead foot I will fake low and go for a head shot. This is one of the most effective strikes if I time it properly. Second to that a spinning back kick can be slipped under the protecting hands of a Wing Chun Fighter if executed quickly enough.</p>

<p>The hardest part again, is keep the Wing Chun fighter away. Quick movement in and out, outside hook heel kicks, and low to high kicks are the best options.</p>
<h2>Which One</h2>
<p>Of the two systems I do prefer Wing Chun for combat.. Even though the Tae Kwon Do fighter might be more mobile, the Wing Chun system provides a more sound answer to attacks. Based on my experience Wing Chun allows me to end a fight much more quickly which to me is the most important part.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>lose weight fast &amp; healthy &#8211; OX DIET</h1>
<p>We at Sifu Och Wing Chun created the OX Diet which is basically eating clean and lean all day.&nbsp; Lose weight fast and healthy with this premise&#8230; you fuel your body by consuming good leans meats, good fats, and vegetables for fiber, vitamins and carbs.&nbsp; By only taking in these things your body can lose weight and help you keep it off.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">WARNING &#8211; THIS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.&nbsp; DON&#8217;T USE IT. I am not a medical doctor, this is based on opinion only.&nbsp; Seek out your personal western doctors opinion first.&nbsp; Before listening or doing anything in this article.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>Now with that WARNING out of the way let us continue.</p>
<ul>
<li>For some people <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>calorie restriction</strong> </span>really works and it gives you a healthy way to get in your cheat foods and lose some weight.&nbsp; Though Fad diets have you bouncing with weight on and off by throwing your body into loops.</li>
<li>If you like your sugars and breads and don&#8217;t have much will power to deny them, then go calorie restrictive, you will still be able to lose weight but you may gain it back too, you also might not have the best potential for ramping up your metabolism.&nbsp; Though you will get to eat cake more often, so tough choices.</li>
<li>Active and Athletic individuals of ANY AGE who want to ramp up their metabolism and keep a clean and lean body,&nbsp;<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">eat clean and well 5-6 times a day </span></strong><span style="color: #000000;">and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>make working</strong><strong> out</strong></span> a <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">priority</span> </strong>to their health and happiness.</span>&nbsp; By feeding the body good food consistently, you show it isn&#8217;t going to starve so instead of storing fat, it burns fat and builds muscle.&nbsp;<strong>If you won&#8217;t give yourself the time to lose weight, workout, make your food, and yourself a priority then go the calorie restrictive diet and don&#8217;t stay on this page.&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Which diet is best for you?</strong></span>&nbsp;<strong>If you have good will power, continue reading.</strong></p>
<p>If you starve your body then your body may lower your metabolism and stores fat to keep you alive.&nbsp; If you want the fat gone you need to train your body to know you won&#8217;t starve it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Instead you are going to feed it the right food and fuel so it knows it won&#8217;t starve and can start getting rid of that excess stored energy and fat around your body.</p>
<h2>STEP 1 &#8211; MEAL PREP</h2>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">So you have decided to eat clean, often, and healthy throughout the day eating only meat and vegetables to start lose weight fast.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>Take a weekend to go out and buy meats and vegetables you will enjoy.&nbsp; Get a bunch of seasonings that you can place on your meat and vegetables before cooking.&nbsp; Some people like less salt in their seasonings, honestly for this as long as it is flavored without sugar, carbs, or dairy your doing well.</p>
<p>Now I usually bake some and grill the rest, but the choice is up to you.&nbsp; Buy enough food for the month, then go home and spend the day cooking with friends or family.&nbsp; After all you meat and vegetables have been grilled, baked, boiled its time to cut them up.&nbsp; Once cut up in to bite size pieces, mix them together and place them into zip lock bags, stack them and freeze them.</p>
<p>This is your fuel for the month, you will eat when ever hungry and will not starve yourself.&nbsp; Instead you are training your body to know it can boost its metabolism and not worry about going into starvation mode.</p>
<h2>STEP 2 &#8211; Hunger and Water</h2>
<p>Eat when your hungry and drink plenty of water.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t starve yourself, you should eat when your hungry. Since your eating the right foods and healthy foods your going to do just fine.&nbsp; You have meal prepped and the food is ready to go so eat it when your hungry.&nbsp; Make sure you drink plenty of tea and water throughout the day.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Eating poorly is a habit, so is eating healthy.&#8221;<br />
</strong><br />
Lose weight fast and healthy by eating grilled, boiled, or baked vegetables and lean meats every day.&nbsp; If your already fit add in non-processed carbs like brown rice, oats, and earth made carbs.&nbsp; If your not fit and looking to lose weight then only vegetables and lean meats for you.&nbsp; &nbsp;You must cut out all sugars, carbs that don&#8217;t come from your vegetables, bread and milk products.</p>
<p><strong>What do I drink?&nbsp;</strong><br />
Without sugar or artificial sweeteners you can drink tea, BCAA flavored drinks, water, and coffee.&nbsp; If you must flavor your drinks use natural sweeteners like stevia.</p>
<h2>STEP 3 &#8211; BODY &amp; COLON CLEANSE</h2>
<p>You can take a body and colon cleanse at any time in the beginning of the diet or when you hit a plateau.&nbsp; When cleaning out your body I prefer something that is gentle, doesn&#8217;t contain senna, and also rids the body of parasites and micro-organisms.&nbsp; &nbsp;After this its a good time to take some probiotics and revitalize your immune system.</p>
<h2>STEP 4 &#8211; KEEP IT UP</h2>
<p>Weigh yourself once a week and keep it up.&nbsp; To lose weight fast &amp; healthy on the OX DIET you have to have a strong will and stay away from temptation.&nbsp; When you start seeing those results don&#8217;t celebrate yet.&nbsp; Keep it up and push through till you get everything you wanted in your weight and body needs.</p>
<h2>WORK OUT</h2>
<p>Cardio is great but you need to lift weights as well.&nbsp; So as you lose weight, lift weight.&nbsp; Find a <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/cardio-lifting-and-martial-arts/">martial art class,</a> or <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/classes/lakeland-kickboxing-weight-loss-bootcamp/">kickboxing</a>, find a gym where you will keep pushing each week to reach your goals.</p>
<h2>INTERMITTENT FASTING</h2>
<p>You don&#8217;t eat for 16 hours and then eat all your food in a 8 hour window.&nbsp; &nbsp;Intermittent fast means you eat all your food and calories for the day in a 8 hour period and then only drink tea, coffee, and water for the rest of the day.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can pick what ever 8 hours during the day is good for you.&nbsp; Though remember once your time starts you can&#8217;t break up that 8 hours.&nbsp; Its 8 hours straight of time to eat your healthy meats and veggies and then only tea, coffee, and water.</p>
<h2>AFTER I HIT MY GOAL WEIGHT</h2>
<p>So you lose weight fast but what happens when you get to your goal weight?&nbsp; At that point you should be adding in more carbs from oats, brown rice, fruit, and earth made carbohydrates.&nbsp; Giving yourself a cheat day once a week is also a great Idea.&nbsp; This helps to throw your body off and gives you a break to eat foods that give your life pleasure and you work off later!</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">ALMOST NO SUGAR or CARBS</span></h2>
<p>Vegetables have a bunch of sugar and carbohydrates already in them, check out this link <a href="https://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/food/vegetables/carbohydrate">https://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/food/vegetables/carbohydrate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>Which means your food should contain all you need.</p>
<p>Vegetables also have tons of vitamins in them check out this link&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lenntech.com/fruit-vegetable-vitamin-content.htm">https://www.lenntech.com/fruit-vegetable-vitamin-content.htm</a></p>
<p>So don&#8217;t fret about not taking in those sugary drinks, candies, cakes, fruits, chips, and dairy products your going to do great.&nbsp; So remember no sugar, no dairy, no carbs that don&#8217;t come from vegetables and no bread.</p>
<p>So if your worried you won&#8217;t get in enough sugar, carbs, or vitamins on the diet you are going to do just fine.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">NO YOU can&#8217;t HAVE IT on the &#8211; OX DIET</span></h2>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t reached your goal weight, you can&#8217;t have the below at all.</p>
<ul>
<li>no sugar at all (not even fruit in until your goal weight is reached.)</li>
<li>no carbs at all (unless from vegetables until your goal weight loss is reached.)</li>
<li>no dairy at all</li>
<li>no bread at all</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to lose weight fast, First you will lose weight fast if you stop taking in sugar (yes even from fruit), carbs from non-vegetable sources, bread and calorie drink products.</p>
<p>So why do diets restrict your calorie intact, make you feel like your starving while body builders eat 6-9 times a day and look like Demi-gods?&nbsp; Calories are the fuel or gas of your body, so if your wanting to have your metabolism run at full tilt you need fuel.&nbsp; Though there is a huge difference in what kind of fuel.</p>
<p>My Diet is hard, you can lose weight fast but it will test your will power and you will want to cheat.&nbsp; Those who don&#8217;t cheat get the prize of great weight loss and a healthier body, those who do cheat (yes, even a little now and again) before they get their goal weight will not attain everything they are after.</p>
<p>If you want a rocky up and down fad diet this isn&#8217;t for you.&nbsp; If you would rather do something easier that won&#8217;t test your will power pick another diet and come back when your really ready.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>WARNING &#8211;&nbsp;I am not a doctor.&nbsp; consult your doctor before doing this diet.&nbsp; THIS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This diet is not forever, you will lose weight and then train yourself to eat in moderation.&nbsp; Eating without heavy amounts of carbs, sugar, and dairy in your life.&nbsp;</em></span></strong></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>My Journey Into Wing Chun: Rich Dorsey. Rich gives his story about his journey training and where he came before Wing Chun.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;My Journey Into Wing Chun: By Rich Dorsey,&#8221; is my story hope you enjoy! </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I&#8217;ve wanted to train in the Wing Chun system specifically ever since I knew of it when I first got started in martial arts as early as my 18th year. My first teacher, a master of Isshin Ryu, was fascinated by it. Upon many of my homework assignments I received then I also was given information, literature and videos about Wing Chun. </span></span></p>
<h2>My Journey Into Wing Chun: By Rich Dorsey</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Those few Karate teachings were basic. I had only begun to scratch the surface of how to use my hands and feet. They are minuscule to the depth I&#8217;ve seen at this early stage of Sifu Och&#8217;s system. Even still I feel many significant differences in the fighting styles. Not only are both of my &#8216;weapons&#8217; straight-on utilizing more than half my body, but my hands (when I&#8217;m practicing my techniques properly) are continuously forward ready to be fired in short range fire attack. This being said I can honestly say I&#8217;ve never had any real training. Even though over the years I&#8217;ve tried many different styles of martial arts even boxing. </span></span></p>
<h3>My Inspiration</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7197 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/24103248/private-wing-chun-lessons-private-lessons-lakeland-florida-fl-210x300.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="300"></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri Light,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I&#8217;ve met many masters and many students but never anyone who has ever truly inspired me. I began to believe my dream of learning Wing Chun and meeting those kinds of individuals was out of reach. Not only did I find what I was looking for, I met one of the best fighters I&#8217;ve ever known. A teacher not only surpassing my expectations in knowledge but one who inspires me still. A system that not only challenges me but one that works. I&#8217;ve seen it work and have felt it work. To this day I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m more inspired by him or fellow students. Not only can I see what it&#8217;s done for myself but I see what it&#8217;s done for them. The changes in us all over the past two years.</span></span></p>
<h3>My Past</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">And before I go on about the many benefits of Sifu Och&#8217;s Wing Chun system it&#8217;s important to me to remember who I was before I came. I&#8217;ve been athletic my entire life. I began calisthenics at the age of five, and weight training as early as eleven. As an adult, I became a personal trainer by trade. My confidence was exuded for all to see. Yet there was always something missing. All my goals in my physical attributes had for the most part been met. I wanted more than just to look like I could kick butt and take names. I wanted to feel it and believe it.</span></span></p>
<h3>Refining Myself</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">So I began refining myself, my cardio respiratory and training on my own to prepare myself for martial arts. Had I known then what I know now I would have just started immediately. When I felt like I was ready that&#8217;s when I found him. &#8216;When the student is ready the master will appear.&#8217; I can honestly say I had no idea what true cardio was. And all the confidence -that I soon realized was only on the surface- was stripped away as soon as I realized how much I didn&#8217;t know. How much younger men (and some women) only half my size and strength could easily defeat me. Most only in the beginning phase of the system. The confidence that I have now runs deep.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<h3>My Future</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The cardio I currently have I could have never imagined. I&#8217;m tougher than I ever could&#8217;ve imagined. These are only a few of the benefits I&#8217;ve gained and being only a short distance along the long road I&#8217;ve begun to travel I can only imagine how much more there is in store for me here. The excitement only grows the more I learn, understand, and experience&#8230;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Sifu Och! WING CHUN!!</span></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Born and raised in Vietnam, I have known Wing Chun as “Vịnh Xuân” which carries the same meaning of “eternal spring”. However, my knowledge about Wing Chun was limited. I assumed that it is just another Chinese martial arts with fancy moves but not applicable in a modern day situation. Not until recently, the Ip Man movie series ignited my interest in Ip Man and the history of Wing Chun. In my paper,&nbsp;Hung Nguyen: Reaching Orange Sash I will tell you my story.</p>
<h2>Hung Nguyen: Reaching Orange Sash</h2>
<p>I came to find out that Wing Chun is a martial arts that emphasizes in realistic defense, economic motions, and bodily structure. Since Wing Chun was initially developed for women, it focuses on “getting the job done” rather than fancy flying kicks or breaking wooden blocks. It uses body mechanics with minimal movements to simultaneously strike and defense.</p>
<h3>Dedication</h3>
<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>I have always wanted to improve my health, strength and overall wellness. However, like many others, I failed to stick with the mundane routine gym work outs. I knew at that time that I need to make a change. I wanted to do something that is interesting and beneficial for my health. The combination of my personal goal and interest in Wing Chun leads me to look for a Wing Chun school in the area.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8896 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/24104512/Hung-2-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/24104512/Hung-2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/24104512/Hung-2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/24104512/Hung-2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/24104512/Hung-2-400x400.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/24104512/Hung-2-600x600.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/24104512/Hung-2.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />My first impression of Tampa Wing Chun Kung Fu is the dedication and friendliness of the instructor, Garret Brumfield. He took the time to explain the basic moves and concept of Wing Chun, helping the students to have a better understanding of Wing Chun. He created a friendly environment which is built upon the enthusiasm of Wing Chun and the respect for each other. Over the past year, my strength and health have improved significantly due to Wing Chun. Garret has always pushed me to work harder not just in Wing Chun technicians but also other aspects such as strength, cardio, and endurance.</p>
<h3>The Difference Here</h3>
<p>While I have never trained in any form of martial arts previously, I have heard many stories about bad experience with martial arts schools. Many schools focus on pushing students through the systems for financial reasons. Students from those schools can quickly earn a black belt in relatively short amount of time. However, they quickly forget what they learned or don’t know how to apply in real life situation. The students are left little training and most importantly with a false sense of security. In my opinion, it is more dangerous to over confident about your ability to self-defense.</p>
<h3>Application</h3>
<p>Unlike many other Wing Chun schools where they focus chi-sao but little in real life situations. The curriculum of Sifu Och Wing Chun is detailed and vast in techniques. Sifu Och Wing Chun emphasizes on basic techniques. It also teaches students to be efficient in attacks and defenses in realistic scenarios. The curriculum is built to ensure that the students can master the techniques. This is done through constant repetition and deep understanding of the concept. Sifu Och has traveled the world and trained under many direct lineages of Ip Man Wing Chun system. He distilled his knowledge to a curriculum in which the best of traditional Wing Chun meets self-defense techniques. This even includes other form<u>s</u> of martial arts.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Finally, Tampa Wing Chun Kung Fu and Sifu Och Wing Chun not only have helped me physically but also mentally. Garret and others have motivated me to keep coming to class even at the times when life gets in the way. They helped me to build up my discipline and determination to make a change and improve my overall well-being. At the end of the day, there is no substitution for dedication and time to mastery in Wing Chun or anything else in life. I am glad and very grateful that I have found Sifu Och Wing Chun and Tampa Wing Chun Kung Fu. It has had a positive impact in my life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7422 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/24103536/ving-tsun-history-1-300x216.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="216">Here on Tony Plasse: Becoming an Orange I explain my story but first, some history. Wing Chun a southern Chinese martial art mentioned during the period of the Red Boat Opera in the Late 1800s. Developed by southern Shaolin monks to help combat the Manchurians. It is influenced by other Fujian martial arts that preferred short steps and close fighting, with arms placed close to the chest and elbows close to the flanks offering protection. A simple boxing form quickly mastered by dedicated practitioners.</p>
<p>Two key figures keeping Wing Chun system alive after the burning of southern temples were Yat Chum Dai Si, 22<sup>nd</sup> generation Siu Lam Grandmaster monk, and Cheung Ng, also known as Tan Sao Ng within the opera. It was taught to other rebels taking refuge with the opera. From there it spread along the coast and rivers of south-eastern China by people who lived by and on the water. The Shaolin nun myth was most likely created to protect the identities of the creators and perpetrators of the Wing Chun system. Wing Chun translates to Spring Chant or Spring Praise.</p>
<h2>Tony Plasse: Becoming an Orange</h2>
<p>I remember my first introduction to Wing Chun Kung Fu was an Ip Man movie three years ago. Did not know much about it, but the movie inspired me to research it. I liked the theory behind and thought it would be more practical for myself. High flying kicks, although cool looking, are not my style. When I finally had the opportunity to attend a class near my house I thought to myself, &#8220;this is great&#8221;.</p>
<h3>My Reaction</h3>
<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>I <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7290 size-full" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/24103358/tony-plass.jpg" alt="" width="297" height="236">have spent the last year training with Sihing Garret and I have noticed improvements in myself. Garret emphasizes physical training at the beginning of each class. I have improved muscle tone and stamina. Wing Chun techniques taught to me have improved my reflexes much to my surprise. Not just in wrist against wrist but in everyday applications. I react to things such as doors flying at my face. I caught one once with a Jum Sau action. The lady next to me said “Wow! That was like a ninja!”. I also catch the items knocked off shelves with a lot more ease.</p>
<h3>My Confidence</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8148 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/24104036/Tony-Plasse-Wing-Chun-Kung-Fu-Tampa-Bay-Florida-153x300.jpg" alt="Tony-Plasse-Wing Chun Kung Fu Tampa Bay Florida" width="153" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/24104036/Tony-Plasse-Wing-Chun-Kung-Fu-Tampa-Bay-Florida-153x300.jpg 153w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/24104036/Tony-Plasse-Wing-Chun-Kung-Fu-Tampa-Bay-Florida.jpg 221w" sizes="(max-width: 153px) 100vw, 153px" />The wrist against wrist drill has helped my sensitivity improve into reaction. It has given me more confidence in handling myself. I always knew my normal movements gave me power. But now I am learning to channel that power more efficiently through stance and technique. I am more confident that I’m more prepared for situations when I’m out on the town or at work. I believe there are many applications I could have used previously in my life as a football player. Namely the footwork and center line punch drill. Both would have greatly helped me as an offensive lineman and coach. It also adds to my overall scariness.</p>
<h3>My Future</h3>
<p>As the days grow closer to my son’s birth, I look forward to sharing Wing Chun with him. I hope he will benefit from Wing Chun training developing skill, balance and confidence. I see Wing Chun as an opportunity to develop father and son bonds.</p>
<p>The instruction and encouragement I receive is outstanding. Sihing Garret and Sifu Och inspire me to dedicate myself and continue training. I hope to be an inspiring instructor one day. I look forward to progressing and to be a good representative of Tampa Bay Wing Chun Kung Fu and Sifu Och Wing Chun.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a reason the title is &#8220;Your Black Belt Journey&#8221;, it&#8217;s YOUR journey. No one else can walk your life. You were created for a purpose and it&#8217;s your job to walk it to the best of your ability. That being said, too many times we see students comparing themselves to another student. In this article I will discuss what it means to walk the journey on the road to a black belt.</p>
<h2>Your Black Belt Journey</h2>
<p>Anything worth having takes time to get. Earning your Masters degree in Engineering, finishing Ranger school, a successful life long marriage. All of these things have something in common, they took a long time and a lot of hard work to achieve and/or maintain. People tend to treat martial arts different. As if learning to defend yourself from a threat is easier then one of these skills. Defending your family while fighting off multiple attackers or maybe even just one is not something you can learn in a weekend seminar. Yet, people continue to say they&#8217;ll &#8220;give it a try&#8221;. Or they will &#8220;do some Wing Chun&#8221; as if it were finger painting session with their friends.</p>
<h3>Building a lifestyle</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7472 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/24103605/contact-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-florida-300x110.jpg" alt="contact sifu och wing chun, kung fu, lakeland, florida, sifu och wing chun, contact us, kung fu lakeland, wing chun lakeland" width="300" height="110" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/24103605/contact-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-florida-300x110.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/24103605/contact-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-florida-768x280.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/24103605/contact-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-florida-400x146.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/24103605/contact-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-florida-600x219.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/24103605/contact-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-florida.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />To really learn self defense you must embrace it as a lifestyle. The same thing that is said about being healthy is true here. If you &#8220;go on a diet&#8221; you will eventually go back to your un-healthy ways. You must change how you live as a whole. You must become a healthy person. They choices you make a the grocery store, restaurants, and gym time. This is who you are and what you do. Not an activity you participate in for a few weeks. The same is exactly true in training self defense.</p>
<h3>But I&#8217;m High enough ranked I&#8217;ll be ok</h3>
<p>In my previous article 3 cycles of martial arts I explain that there are 3 main stages to training: Programming, Application, Reaction. <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-6745 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/24102759/lakeland-fl-sifu-och-florida-wing-chun-schools1-191x300.jpg" alt="Advanced Wing Chun classes sparring training" width="191" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/24102759/lakeland-fl-sifu-och-florida-wing-chun-schools1-191x300.jpg 191w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/24102759/lakeland-fl-sifu-och-florida-wing-chun-schools1.jpg 217w" sizes="(max-width: 191px) 100vw, 191px" />All 3 take time to develop in reference to a technique. But the most important thing is they must be maintained. If you do not keep up your training then you will NOT BE ABLE to respond to a threatening situation. Reacting to an attack takes split second reflexes as well as a situational awareness that maximizes your time. You may remember techniques from your training time but applying them quick enough will be very hard to accomplish.</p>
<p>The proof of this is many previous higher ranking students will come back from a hiatus and will struggle greatly with sparing and gor sao and lower ranking current students. That being said, setting goals and reaching them is a huge help when it comes to training as you go. But you should not have a rank as an end game. Living your life like a Black Sash is the key.</p>
<h2>You Must Change</h2>
<p>The Sash itself is NOT the goal in martial arts. It is the person you become while trying to obtain it. When you envision a person who is a &#8220;Black Sash&#8221; you typically picture someone who is wise, patient, hard working, compassionate. You must become the person you envision as a Black Sash. That transformation into something new only happens under the heavy anvil of rigorous, consistent training. Be reaching for small goals (i.e. your next rank) you have something you can slowly move towards and develop those characteristics on the way.</p>
<p>Nobody else can walk this path for you. You must accept where you are as a human. Recognize the type of person you must become. If you were a Black Sash how hard would you train? How compassionate would you be towards others? How loving would you be towards your family? These characteristics are what make a Black Sash. What are you doing to become that?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have just begun your training in martial arts you know it can become very frustrating. You can feel lost in the material. Confused on a technique. Or you feel like you are behind where you should be. All of the these factors make starting martial arts difficult for the newbie. In this article, 3 Training Cycles of Martial Arts, we will explain a concept that will hopefully help you push past the first slump.</p>
<h2>The 3 Training Cycles of Martial Arts</h2>
<p>There are 3 basic stages of learning a new technique. Once you understand these stages you will be able to identify where you are and what you need to work on. What you must understand is everyone develops different. Some learn the initial technique faster than others. Yet those same students may struggle in applying it. Everyone learns different. You must accept where you are so you can focus on YOUR development. Don&#8217;t stress about the progress of others. That being said, lets look at these 3 stages.</p>
<h3>Stage 1: Programming</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7794 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/24103714/learn-self-defense-now-300x200.jpg" alt="learn self defense now" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/24103714/learn-self-defense-now-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/24103714/learn-self-defense-now-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/24103714/learn-self-defense-now-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/24103714/learn-self-defense-now-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/24103714/learn-self-defense-now.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The first stage of training begins with programing. This is exactly like installing a new system into a computer. It takes time. When a new technique is shown it comes with a new set of motor functions the body is not used to. To overcome this the body needs time to &#8220;program&#8221; the new function into the &#8220;hard-drive&#8221;. Some students are more prone to certain techniques. Maybe they grew up doing a certain sport that had a similar movement to what they are learning now.</p>
<p>For instance, in Wing Chun there is a lot of rooting through the heels. If someone spent a lot of time lifting growing up they might be able to grasp that concept a little quicker. As opposed to someone who played soccer for instance. They would have been taught to always be in their toes. Therefore, they would need to spend more time teaching their body to draw power from the heels then the first person.</p>
<h3>Stage 2: Application</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7856 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103757/Developing-the-Student-Mindset-300x200.jpg" alt="Developing the Student Mindset" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103757/Developing-the-Student-Mindset-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103757/Developing-the-Student-Mindset-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103757/Developing-the-Student-Mindset-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103757/Developing-the-Student-Mindset-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103757/Developing-the-Student-Mindset.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Secondly, after you have learned what the new technique is and how to perform it you must learn WHEN to perform it. This is called application. One technique can have many applications and then variations from that original. Applying the technique must also be treated like the programing because you are learning how to time it against an attack. You must be attacked over and over again to get the timing down.</p>
<p>Along with timing the technique another very important part of application is learned and testing: structure. Without structure a block or attack will be ineffective no mater the timing. Just like gold is refined in fire so must the structure of a technique be refined through the fire of pressure. Pressure testing your structure helps develop your shapes that shadow training (or practicing in the air) can never do. Real attacks must be thrown and you to really develop your structure. Combining the timing and pressure training will give you the ability to fully apply your techniques.</p>
<h3>Stage3: Reaction</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8764 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104425/20273304_10213122446550885_1533157015_o-1-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104425/20273304_10213122446550885_1533157015_o-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104425/20273304_10213122446550885_1533157015_o-1-400x533.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104425/20273304_10213122446550885_1533157015_o-1-768x1025.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104425/20273304_10213122446550885_1533157015_o-1-450x600.jpg 450w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104425/20273304_10213122446550885_1533157015_o-1.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />Thirdly, the final stage of developing your technique is reaction. You have could structure and timing, but how will your fair when you do not know when the attack is coming? Reaction is the hardest part of training. You must build one technique at time. Learn how to react to one certain attack. Once you have dealt with that you build again from step one. Program a new technique; apply it to real attacks; react to it in a sparring scenario. You must learn how to deal with skilled and un-skilled attacks. Single attackers and multiple attackers. As well as Feinting, counter striking, grappling, High-low hit combos. All of these things and more must be thrown at you.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this cycle must be repeated over and over again. Day by day, technique by technique, this must be done. Consequently, if you stay consistent with your training you will master every technique given to you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Jacob Cramer: Orange Sash Pre-Requisite Paper. I explain the beginning of  my story and how I began my martial art journey.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>Where to Begin? Where does one begin divulging the effervescent determination surrounding my growth in Sifu Och Wing Chun? But also the growth in myself.</p>
<h2>Jacob Cramer: Orange Sash Pre-Requisite Paper</h2>
<h3>The Beginning</h3>
<p>Ultimately the scrupulous truth would be in my young age of six when I as many martial artist has divulged found my passion for martial arts watching Enter the Dragon featuring Bruce Lee. It was my favorite movie to rewatch and practice the moves of in my mom’s living room. From that moment on I knew I wanted to learn more about Bruce lee but also learn more about martial arts. Growing up we didn’t have much extra money so my passion laid with tutorial videos, school wrestling team, and books explaining how to train and learn new moves or techniques.</p>
<h3>Ip Man</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7403 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/24103514/Ip-Man-Yip-Man-230x300.jpg" alt="Ip Man, Yip Man, Grandmaster Ip Man, Grandmaster Yip Man" width="230" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/24103514/Ip-Man-Yip-Man-230x300.jpg 230w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/24103514/Ip-Man-Yip-Man.jpg 345w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px" />Fast forward to the important part, the year 2009 when the film Ip Man was released in the united states red box system, I was helping my grandpa move when he out of kindness decided to rent a movie for me and my brother. He casually strolls in and I will never forget what he said “you Know you guys have worked real hard and I wanted to show a small gesture of appreciation, I know you both love martial arts so I saw a film on Bruce lee’s master in red box and thought it would be interesting for you to check out.”</p>
<p>Little did I know that night after years of watching, reading, and jumping styles when able I would find my passion. I watched the film and fell in love with the pure flow of combinations, relentless ferocity in each hit and it wasn’t flashy but it was unprecedentedly fast and effective.</p>
<p>I begin with this prelude only to set the proper background for why I study as hard as I do and why I have such an appreciation for every moment I spend learning something in Sifu Och Wing chun.</p>
<h3>The Search</h3>
<p>In my years of martial arts fanaticism and study I have trained in my styles of course seeing as I have landed in Sifu Och Wing Chun never were for very long. The complete breakdown would be six months of high school wrestling, a month of Muay Thai, a month of Goju-Ru karate, and Six months of Sport Judo. I gained a proper understanding of what most martial arts schools were about because of the many styles that I bounced around in.</p>
<p>The schools primarily focused on the money, they would show you a couple moves leave you on your own and then after a bit would ask if you want to join up. This was an industry standard I did not like, so I often parted ways, if I wasn’t sure I maybe stuck around for a bit to maybe see if I was judging to quickly or harshly. I feel that my jumping styles did in fact help me grow as a martial artist however the training only took me so far and let’s be honest it wasn’t very far at all. I still had nervousness in fighting situations or even in confrontational situations.</p>
<h3>Home</h3>
<p>Sifu Och Wing Chun has and will always be a blessing to me. It’s not simply a school to learn how to defend yourself, for me it’s so much more. To elaborate in greater detail and analysis it’s a family that helps me when I&#8217;m struggling. It’s a support group to help me further grow as a martial artist however the training only took me so far and let’s be honest it wasn’t very far at all. I still had nervousness in fighting situations or even in confrontational situations.</p>
<p>Sifu Och Wing Chun has and will always be a blessing to me, its not simply a school to learn how to defend yourself, for me it’s so much more. To elaborate in greater detail and analysis it’s a family that helps me when I’m struggling. It’s a support group to help me further my physical and mental goals. And it’s also the one place in the world where I feel myself separate from my troubles.</p>
<h3>The Training 1</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8587 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104325/growth-in-wing-chun-kung-fu-170x300.jpg" alt="Growth in Wing Chun Kung Fu lakeland Fl" width="170" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104325/growth-in-wing-chun-kung-fu-170x300.jpg 170w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104325/growth-in-wing-chun-kung-fu.jpg 226w" sizes="(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px" />First note I am going to touch on is the benefits of the training I receive from Tampa Wing Chun and Lakeland Wing Chun with my martial arts growth. When I began a little over a year ago I was nervous when entering a physical confrontation, however from the moment I joined (Like literally Day One) I was put into wrist vs wrist. This automatic exposure with the accommodations of the further advanced students I could not only overcome the fear but also conquer it. Now I love sparring and wrist vs wrist.</p>
<p>As a result when situations outside in my daily life seem to be escalating I don’t worry, I am able to keep a level head. This allows for proper understanding of my surroundings and better problem solving analysis. Sifu Och wing chun also gives realistic defense training. Whereas in other schools I have found what felt like rigid motions that are supposed to at some point just become natural. Sifu Och Wing Chun has offered close quartered and naturally fast movements that take your body no time to understand and implement. It may take years to perfect or tweak to get it in the state you most desire. But in the beginning, you already see significant differences.</p>
<h3>The Training 2</h3>
<p>Second I also found a school that talks to each other. Where older, more intimidating students walk up to the newbies and say hello.Give praise while also offering helpful criticism instead of sink or swim. It’s a place where I feel at home, not judged and where only growth is possible. Growth of the self, growth of the heart, and growth of body and mind. Nowhere I have crossed paths with has ever come within striking range of what is offered.</p>
<p>All of what I wrote hopefully explains why I love what I do at Sifu Och Wing Chun, why I drive 2 and a half hours for private lessons, tests, classes, and get together, and dream of one day offering a place of Sifu Och Wing Chun where I end up when I become Sifu.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Road to Orange: By Dixon Kwok. Before getting in to Wing Chun, I never had much martial arts training. I took Tae kwon do for a bit but my mom pulled me out not long after I got my yellow belt. This was due to her reading an article that said doing martial arts stunted growth. I personally never believed it, but I was only in I think elementary school and it’s not like I could convince her otherwise.</span></span></p>
<h2>Road to Orange: By Dixon Kwok</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> After that I never gave martial arts much thought. Even so I’ve always enjoyed sports and athletic activities so I’ve pretty much tried every sport one could think of over the years. However, because I changed interests so much, I never really joined a team and received formal training. The exception to this was swimming only due to my parents will and not my own. Because of this I grew up to be a rather athletic and coordinated person and learned things rather fast and quickly. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Since I did keep switching between sports depending on what was on TV I lacked commitment and because I was usually playing by myself or with friends. I would just stop whenever I got tired or didn’t feel like continuing. This led me to lack motivation to push through when things got too hard because there was no one to force me to keep going and push my limits.</span></span></p>
<h2>My Inspiration</h2>
<p><figure id="attachment_8847" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8847" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-8847 size-full" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/24104503/Dixon-2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8847" class="wp-caption-text">Dixon Kwow Training for His Orange Sash Test</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> A little over a year ago though, I was watching a TV show and one of the characters saved a stranger through the use of martial arts. It sparked a whole new interest in martial arts for me. I talked it over with my friend and he seemed like he was interested in learning a martial art too. Which would be something we could to together.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> Seeing&nbsp;how I’ve pretty much already finished growing I didn’t see a reason my mom would not allow me to take a martial arts now. So I figured it wouldn’t hurt to ask and try out martial arts again. Sure enough she gave me the ok.So I started researching which martial arts I wanted to do. I looked over the usual ones most would hear about in this day and age like Karate, Tae Kwon Do, Boxing, etc. After a bit of research though I decided I wanted to do one that was closer to my birthplace Hong Kong.</span></span></p>
<h3>Searching for the Right Style</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> From that I started up looking for styles of Chinese martial arts. I stumbled upon a site that listed a whole bunch of styles of Kung Fu. These were split into northern and southern styles. So I looked through the southern styles and see Wing Chun. When I looked at its main points and realized it’s very in line with what I’m interested. Being more direct, relying on speed to wear down the opponent. As opposed to a huge powerful blow to end it all. Strong and no flashy stuff that is often more likely to look cool than actually work in a fight. As I did more research, I found out it was also the martial art that Bruce Lee and Ip Man practiced. This helped me get a better idea of what it looked like and how it was executed. I decided to go ahead with this one.</span></span></p>
<h2>My Beginning</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">My friend ended up getting interested in something else and dropping out of our plan. I figured I would do it regardless. Now a little over a year later as I test for my orange sash I am very happy with my choice. The class has become like another family. I can come and progress each week and also have good times with. There is an atmosphere that makes me want to keep pushing and get better and better. Although morning classes on Saturday are often really rough, it’s often worth it.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I’m glad to be learning Wing Chun in this system as unlike many other systems. It is focused on making us fighters instead of belt chasers. It isn’t about just getting to the next belt but making sure I’m actually capable of holding my own. That is why I wanted to learn a martial art in the first place. This has been an incredible journey so far and I will keep going as far as I can.</span></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">The form, or kata, is present in almost every possible martial art. Each art will, however, vary in how much emphasis and time it spends working on these forms. Some martial arts incorporate them, but do not place much emphasis on perfecting them; while others will spend a great deal of their time working on mastering all their forms. Either way, forms are an essential part of martial arts – yet an often underappreciated one. We will explain Importance of Martial Art Forms here.<br />
</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">What is a kata?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8813 " src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/24104445/kata-236x300.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="234" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/24104445/kata-236x300.jpg 236w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/24104445/kata.jpg 394w" sizes="(max-width: 185px) 100vw, 185px" /></span>“<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">Kata” is a Japanese word that literally translates into “form” in English. At its core a form is simply a sequence of martial art techniques, or one side of a choreographed fight. The main goal of a form is to preserve and drill techniques for new and future generations of practitioners. The idea is that you learn a multitude of skills while executing your art’s blocks and strikes. These blocks and strikes then become your muscle memory and are much easier to execute in a sparring or fighting scenario. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">When is it used?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">Present day forms are often used in demonstrations and competitions. For competitions, judges will score on a ten point scale that is usually given after all competitors have demonstrated their form. That way they can compare competitors against each other and score them accordingly. In days past, forms were used as military drills or as a sign of defiance towards the government. The forms were sometimes used with weapons and empty hand to drill fighting techniques in soldiers. While in other areas, the form was done after a long day of enslavement to show slave drivers that they could not break their spirit. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">What skills do we gain from forms?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">Practicing forms has the opportunity to offer many benefits. The most obvious being the learning and drilling of a new technique or sequence. One must do forms repeatedly, giving the practitioner ample time to work on mastering the skill. Some forms are more focused on centering the mind of the practitioner and preparing them for the class they are about to enjoy. These forms will appear more meditative and will warm up the necessary muscles for class. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">Enhancement of overall martial art skill</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">There is also a subset of skills that practicing forms enhances in any martial artist. This includes power, breath control, focus, precision, and muscle memory. Power comes through the repetition and learning how to add torque and core strength behind your strikes. Breath control is another, often forgotten, aspect of both power and focus. Proper breathing during forms allows one to channel more energy behind their strikes as well as focus their attention on the one hit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">Precision of technique occurs in the practitioner through repetition. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">The more repetition, the more precise the movements become. Likewise the muscle memory gained through practicing forms allows for techniques to become more natural and automatic. So that when needed, the body has no problem executing the technique. It becomes much more likely that you will be able to use the moves with a split seconds warning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">Though many of these skills are often taught verbally, like most aspects of martial arts, you have to practice to make the art your own. Practicing forms is important because it gives the artist time to work through their martial art and learn new things along the way. Forms preserve history and teach us lessons long past, learned from those that came before us. The next time you practice your form, ask yourself: am I just going through the motions, or am I really getting all that I can from this form?</span></p>

<p><a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/black-belt-kids/kids-black-belt-ranking-florida/" rel="attachment wp-att-8827"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8827 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/24104458/kids-black-belt-ranking-florida-171x300.jpg" alt="black belt kids, kids black belt, kids, black belt, martial arts, karate, kung fu, wing chun" width="171" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/24104458/kids-black-belt-ranking-florida-171x300.jpg 171w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/24104458/kids-black-belt-ranking-florida.jpg 205w" sizes="(max-width: 171px) 100vw, 171px" /></a>We don&#8217;t believe in Black Belt kids, but we do believe in building the Black Belt Kid mentality. &nbsp;We feel much like college and advanced learning a Black Belt is meant for a matured mind and body in the martial arts.</p>
<p>But despite our opinions Black Belt kids happen more and more every year. &nbsp;Some call them McDojo&#8217;s, giving kids (some under 14 years old) black belt level within a short period of time, all to get them to stay and parents to keep paying. &nbsp;Of course parents and children are led to believe that the martial art instructor and staff are uplifting their child a through earned achievement.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>So where do you stand? &nbsp;Should your child become a Black Belt Kid? &nbsp;Or is your child already a Black Belt Kid?</strong></span></p>
<p>With after school programs having children start as young as 5 and within a few years achieving a Black Belt something that use to be reserved for elite adults. Training over years and proving everything they had to learn against grow men. With more and more schools opening up and ranking children faster to keep them and the parents happy, where does it end.</p>
<h2>Ranking is not about color, but capability</h2>
<p><a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/black-belt-kids/kids-black-belt-ranking-martial-arts-karate-kung-fu/" rel="attachment wp-att-8830"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8830" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/24104500/kids-black-belt-ranking-martial-arts-karate-kung-fu-171x300.jpg" alt="martial art, kids, kids black belt, black belt kids, " width="171" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/24104500/kids-black-belt-ranking-martial-arts-karate-kung-fu-171x300.jpg 171w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/24104500/kids-black-belt-ranking-martial-arts-karate-kung-fu.jpg 205w" sizes="(max-width: 171px) 100vw, 171px" /></a>THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, ranking for our school is hard to achieve, must be earned and is not about color. We believe ranking should be about skill and attitude built &amp; achieved. &nbsp;It’s always nice to get a new belt, a symbol of achievement. Many years ago BLACK BELT was a Title held Like a Masters Degree. Now children are just given black belts. Can they stop an adult attacker? or a Larger Bully? -OR- Did they receive the promise of a Black Belt to keep you paying &amp; them coming?</p>
<p>We talk to parents weekly who tell us that their child can’t protect themselves but the have or are about to achieve their Black Belt. So what is it worth then? What happens when that symbol is given out easily, it cheapen’s it.</p>
<p><a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/kung-fu-kids-keeping-your-kids-engaged/">PARENTS &amp; CHILDREN</a> Not realizing that the reason a Black Belt is revered is because of the skill, attitude, focus and determination it took to achieve. WE BELIEVE A BLACK BELT SHOULD BE A SYMBOL OF A LIFE CHANGE &amp; ACCOMPLISHMENT. NOT A CHILD&#8217;S TOY TO WANT, AND YOU TO BUY YOUR WAY THROUGH.</p>
<h2>Belt Colors &amp; different Schools</h2>
<p>We at SIFU OCH WING CHUN believe that lasting skill is taught daily, not because of a black belt promise. But the life skills taught and honed by teachers who give their all. Parents who don’t let their kids quit and students who do their best everyday. &nbsp;If your child wanted to quit Elementary School would you let them? <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/cuts-collisions-crying-tips-for-your-kids-program/">Some kids want to quit whats hard</a>, what they aren&#8217;t immediately good at. &nbsp;Will you let your child quit before they have truly achieved?</p>
<p>Our program here at Sifu Och Wing Chun doesn&#8217;t believes in having a child earn a black belt. &nbsp;We provide a clear way for children to make their way through our young children&#8217;s class and move smoothly into our teen and adult classes. A Black Belt or in our case since we train Wing Chun Kung Fu, a Black Sash is something that must not be taken lightly.</p>
<h2>OUR MARTIAL ARTS SCHOOLS BELIEF</h2>
<p><a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/black-belt-kids/black-belt-kids-ranking-martial-arts-karate-kung-fu/" rel="attachment wp-att-8832"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-8832 alignright" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/24104501/black-belt-kids-ranking-martial-arts-karate-kung-fu-300x216.jpg" alt="black belt kids, black belt, kids, ranking, martial arts, karate, kung fu" width="300" height="216"></a>We don&#8217;t believe in Black Belt Kids, we don&#8217;t believe in handing out ranks.</p>
<p><strong>We believe a Black Belt like a going to college, it needs a mature mind and body to achieve. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Instead of focusing on the belt rank, we focus on the life skills they are achieving and who they are becoming as an individual. &nbsp;Will they make good choices or bad choices in life? &nbsp;Will you hope they do or train them to do so? &nbsp;We believe these LIFE SKILLS are more important then the focus on a BLACK BELT. &nbsp;For us a BLACK BELT is a level of physical, mental, and emotional skill that as an adult we are mature enough to handle and gain the most from.</p>
<p>A child may be in the excelled learning program but it doesn&#8217;t mean they have the same understanding you do about the World now. &nbsp;A child&#8217;s mind and body, their experience in the World and what they could achieve is what we aim to develop. &nbsp;Uplifting them every step of the way. &nbsp;We believe you earn what you train and what you prove you know. &nbsp;Sifu Och Wing Chun builds a childs self esteem, skill, and personal determination. &nbsp;All of this can uplift a child without giving them the false understanding of black belt ranking.</p>
<h2>Belt Rank signifies Growth and Understanding of Skill</h2>
<p>In our classes belt ranking signifies what you understand and what we can now give you to build on what you have already trained and shown you understand. &nbsp;You may not have Mastered it yet, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t give you time and training to do so while teaching you more!</p>
<p>Black Belt Kids is a child seeking a new goal, not understanding its significance? &nbsp;If a child&#8217;s only goal in sit is getting that Black Belt then what is it worth if you get it easily? Our program builds a child up, their self defense skills, focus, and learning how to achieve in life. So they can transition through each phase in life, growing with our program in to the older kids classes, teen and adult programs.</p>
<h2><strong>Your Opinion on Black Belt Kids Ranking</strong></h2>
<p>If your reading this tell us how you motivate your children in your program. &nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>How do you rank a child who is 5 years old looking to achieve and keep them going until they are an adult? &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>How do you get them to focus on more than just a belt? &nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>When do you believe its a good time to rank a person to Black Belt and why?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Do you have kids that are Black Belts, tell us if your opinion differs and why?</strong></span></p>
<p>Train with us. Achieve with us. Win with us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The world of modern martial arts is full of commercialized schools with watered down training. In an attempt to please the masses, martial arts has become what people want it to be and drifted away from what it was. The following is a list of common Lost Qualities of Modern Martial Arts. Some of these are either severely lacking or missing entirely.<br />
</span></span></p>
<h2>Lost Qualities of Modern Martial Arts</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>The art of manipulation</b></span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8293 " src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24104105/aikido69-300x201.jpg" alt="Throwing your opponent" width="249" height="167" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24104105/aikido69-300x201.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24104105/aikido69-768x516.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24104105/aikido69-400x269.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24104105/aikido69-600x403.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24104105/aikido69.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px" /></b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The ability to make your opponent do exactly what it is that you want them to. This may mean causing them to react to something that you throw and then exploiting their reaction. Or using their previous attack to your advantage by controlling it and guiding it into your next attack. Manipulation also involves the use of feints and other misleading maneuvers that end in a desired response.</span></span></li>
<li>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>The art of timing</b></span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Timing is an essential martial art skill, and most learn it through trial and error. The problem with this approach is that it takes a very long time for the practitioner to be able to execute proper timing and even longer to understand what they are doing. Timing training can and should be supplemented with drills that specifically target the skill. </span></span></li>
<li>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Ducking, bobbing, and weaving</b></span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Too often do we choose to rely exclusively on the blocks that our art has taught us, while completely ignoring the fact that we don’t actually need to even make contact with the attack. Not only does this eliminate the blow, but we are also able to keep both of our hands up and ready to attack at will.</span></span></li>
<li>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Development of senses</b></span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">This quality refers to both improving our natural senses and becoming more aware of our surroundings. Improved senses naturally increase our situational awareness and both lend themselves to increasing our personal safety. Allowing us to be able to effectively use our martial art skill. </span></span></li>
<li>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Conditioning</b></span></span></h2>
<p><figure id="attachment_7427" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7427" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-7427 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/24103543/ving-tsun-wing-chun-history-300x216.jpg" alt="Kung Fu Training" width="300" height="216"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-7427" class="wp-caption-text">Shaolin Conditioning</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Though highly prized by some schools, many others choose to ignore the benefits of conditioning. The body should be able to withstand a good degree of abuse in order to have the confidence to be an effective fighter. Odds are that you will get hit, what counts is that you are able to come back from that hit and power through – causing more damage to your opponent. </span></span></li>
<li>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Developing intent over instinct</b></span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Many fighters prove to be either overly intentional in their movements or overly instinctual. A good martial artist will develop a fighting style that balances these two traits, and develops the muscle memory required to execute it. To a point where they are strategic, yet also reactive with good instincts. </span></span></li>
<li>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Proper breath control</b></span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Developing appropriate breathing supports each and every martial art technique. Allowing for more focused and powerful strikes. As well as better cardiovascular function and endurance during a match.</span></span></li>
<li>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Familiarity of pressure points</b></span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">When all else fails, it is always nice to know how to exploit pressure points. Often times it is the more muscular men that are more susceptible to this exploitation, due to the greater surface area and nerve endings the muscles bring. </span></span></li>
<li>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Simultaneous blocking and attacking</b></span></span></h2>
<p><figure id="attachment_8536" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8536" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-8536 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104258/Wing-Chun-Lakeland-Florida-Kung-Fu-Deep-Patel-training-classes-300x216.jpg" alt="my lakeland wing chun journey deep patel florida" width="300" height="216"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8536" class="wp-caption-text">Tan Sao Punch</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Many martial arts will focus on blocking an attack, and then following that block with a strike. Instead of choosing to defend and attack at the same time. They get stuck on their traditional blocks while the opposite hand just idly sits and waits.</span></span></li>
<li>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Development of character and personal strength</b></span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Finally, martial arts is not in its’ entirety about fighting. A true martial artist aspires to better themselves in every area of their life, from their character to their physical fitness. They choose to respect themselves and others, and strive to pass on the great knowledge that the martial arts has taught them. </span></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">All martial arts were designed during times of strife in order to combat the ugliest parts of humanity. You must keep these in mind during training to ensure the original intentions of these arts are not forgotten. Does your school incorporate all, some, or none of these qualities? </span></span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The Kickers Guide H-Z (Part II) Goes over part 2 of this 2 part set of articles covering most of the kicks that are used in martial arts. </p>
<p>The post <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/the-kickers-guide-h-z-part-ii/">The Kickers Guide H-Z (Part II)</a> appeared first on <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com">Sifu Och Wing Chun</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">If you have not read part I of The Kickers Guide,&nbsp;please take a minute to do so before jumping into The Kickers Guide H-Z (Part II)! As mentioned in the previous article, every martial art that uses these kicks does so in a multitude of ways. None exactly the same, but each useful to their art.</span></p>
<h1>The Kickers Guide H-Z (Part II)</h1>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Hook Kick</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">A hook kick is simply a </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><u>side kick</u></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"> that misses its target and draws back to hit with the heel. This emulates hook punches in that it is much more difficult to block than other kicks, as it hooks around the opponents guard. This kick is often aimed at head level or upper torso.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Hurricane/Tornado Kick</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">The hurricane and tornado are both spinning jump kicks that are very similar in nature and execution, but with a few differences. For the hurricane kick the front leg initiates the spin, as the back leg comes up for the first strike. The first strike is a </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><u>reverse half moon kick</u></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"> (mentioned in Part I), immediately followed by a </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><u>half moon kick</u></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"> from the other leg. Both kicks occur in the air with neither foot touching the ground. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">The tornado kick is nearly identical, except the final strike is a </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><u>round house</u></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"> instead of a </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><u>half moon kick</u></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">. In addition, the first leg is more of a primer than an actual strike. Both kicks, however, aim to hit the side of the body/head and can be interchangeable. The tornado kick may provide more power due to the nature of the </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><u>round house</u></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">, but the hurricane gives a greater ability to stay square and facing the opponent after the last strike.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Round House </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">There are many acceptable ways to perform a round house, but they all begin with a raised knee. The round house may attack any part of the body, but the height of the target sometimes alters the nature of the move. For low kicks, you almost always want the kick to come at a downward angle; with the foot loaded above the knee, coming down to hit its target. This is more difficult to do if you are aiming for the head and most styles will allow the foot to come upwards to meet this target. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Scissor Kick</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">The term scissor kick is more of a category of kicks encompassing any kick that resembles a pair of scissors. This kick can refer to a double leg sweep from the ground, a double kick striking two targets in opposite directions, or even a crushing motion done to something in between the legs.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Shadow Kicks</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">The name of this kick originates from the idea that the technique takes place in the shadow of the practitioner’s hands. This means that the practitioner should be capable of performing the kick off the front foot while hand maneuvers are being executed. The technique itself is exactly like the </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><u>half crescent kick</u></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"> except instead of being aiming at the ribs in a forward thrust, it aims at the knee a in a downward stomping motion.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Side Kick</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">The side kick is useful against opponents that are already on the right or left sides of our bodies. It can also be used simply as a powerful kick. This kick has great potential for power due to the load that comes up and across the body. The foot is then sent out in a straight line to meet the target. This is different than other kicks. Most of the mentioned kicks take some sort of circular or angled route to their target; thereby cutting their power.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Twist/Inverted-Round Kick</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Similar to the </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><u>round house</u></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">, however, this kick comes from the inside out. The knee comes up to the chest. Foot angles in past the centerline of the body, then kicks angled up with pointed toes. This kick frequently attacks the side of the head or ribs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Many of these kicks can be doubled as spin kicks, jump kicks, spinning jump kicks, or running-spinning-jump kicks. The possibilities are endless. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Kicking is hands down one of my favorite things to do. It’s just so versatile. Once you learn how to use your legs, a whole new world of possibilities opens up. And it is a beautiful world. But this world is full of complexities and a ridiculous amount of different kicks. Not to mention the fact that almost every martial art will perform each kick slightly differently. These two facts combine to make learning kicks more difficult than it needs to be, but we are here to help clear some of that confusion. The Kickers Guide A-H (Part I) is a nearly comprehensive list of kicks known to the martial arts world:</span></p>
<h1>The Kickers Guide A-H (Part I)</h1>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Axe Kick</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">An axe kick is usually preformed either to someone already on the ground or to the collarbone/sternum of a standing opponent. Use a straight leg to come in a downward motion striking with the heel. The two biggest variances are in the load of the kick: some people perform axe kicks by swinging a straight leg up into the air and back down again, while others bring their knee to their chest, kick up, and then drive down. The first is easier to perform and more common. The second offers a more controlled technique and is better for attacking a standing opponent.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Back Kick </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Also known as a donkey kick, this kick attacks an opponent that is directly behind you. This kick is more commonly used in fights where there are multiple opponents, as for a general rule you would not want to turn your back on an opponent. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Butterfly Kick</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">This kick is often more for demonstration than practical self defense. It comes from either standing, or a running step in. The body twists as both legs come off the ground, one after the other, with the entire body more or less parallel to the ground. Striking occurs with the heel coming down on the opponent. A very beautiful kick.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Fish Kick </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">A flick like kick done with pointed toes, typically aimed at the groin. The kick comes up in a snapping motion, with the strike occurring somewhat like the flick of a fish’s tail. This kick also targets the head during fighting combinations that end with the opponent being pulled down to knee height.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Front Kick (Push/Snap)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">A front kick refers to either an upward snapping motion (striking under the chin), or a forward thrusting motion (pushing with the ball of the foot). Either way, the kick comes in a direct line in front of the body, usually with the hips squared. This kick is often used to push opponents away, or as an entry move to a follow up technique.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Half-Moon/Crescent (Reverse Half-Moon/Crescent)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">This kick starts with the knee brought up and into the chest. The foot is then thrust out and around, from the outside of the body in. The reverse kick comes from the inside out. This kick is primarily used as an entry move to get past an opponent’s guard, but can also strike to the side of the face or body.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Half Crescent/Tong Kick</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">A forward thrusting kick done with the foot and knee tilted at a 45° angle to the outside of the centerline. Directed toward the knees, hip, or ribs. The Tong kick is similar to the Half Crescent Kick, except the foot and knee are tilted at a 45° angle to the inside of the centerline. This can be aimed at the diaphragm or chin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">These kicks and more make up the bottom half of our martial art strikes, keep an eye out for our next article on the second half of these kicks!</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Punches Across the Arts: When a Karate guy says punch, and a Wing Chun guy says punch, they don’t always mean the same thing.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/punches-across-the-arts/">Punches Across the Arts</a> appeared first on <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com">Sifu Och Wing Chun</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The punch is a staple in every conceivable martial art. Even those that focus on ground work, like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, at least address how to defend against a punch. In short, martial artists like to punch. But when a Karate guy says punch, and a Wing Chun guy says punch, they don’t always mean the same thing. Punches across the arts vary widely and each art has its own reasoning for choosing to punch slightly differently.</p>
<h2>Karate &amp; Tae Kwon Do</h2>
<p>When it comes to Karate and Tae Kwon Do, the punch is exactly the same. As a martial artist holding an instructor level in Karate, I figured that I would not have to research the Karate punch and moved straight into Tae Kwon Do. The very first video I found on Tae Kwon Do punching sounded like I could have made it myself and called it “The Karate Punch.” This punch primarily hits with the first two knuckles closest to the thumb. If you make a fist, you should be able to draw a line from those two knuckles straight up your arm, matching the bones in the forearm. In traditional drills practitioners will chamber at the waist or hip and strike out as the other arm draws back with equal force. However, in sparring or other applications, the punch will usually come from somewhere near the face. Practitioners use this punch because it allows for the structure of the arm to back up the power of the punch.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-8779 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/24104439/karate-235x300.jpg" alt="" width="235" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/24104439/karate-235x300.jpg 235w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/24104439/karate.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>WIng CHun</h2>
<p>In Wing Chun Kung Fu, the punch looks a little different. Instead of a fist with fingers down parallel to the floor, the Wing Chun punch ranges between a 45 degree angle to perpendicular to the ground (depending on the school); with the pointer finger at the crest of the angle and the pinky at the bottom. These punches come through the centerline of a practitioner’s body, attacking with a square chest. The punch strikes from a state of relaxation to tension. It is less forceful than the Karate or TKD punch, but can deliver the same power. Practitioners use this punch for a couple of reasons. This punch is “invisible” because it is often more difficult to see coming. By simply taking the shortest and most direct route to its destination. It also requires the opponent to be closer, being more effective for close quarter contact.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-7586 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/24103633/whipping-punch-300x200.jpg" alt="whipping punch broken down" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/24103633/whipping-punch-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/24103633/whipping-punch-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/24103633/whipping-punch-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/24103633/whipping-punch-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/24103633/whipping-punch.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_1383" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1383" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-1383 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/24101329/sifu-och-wing-chun-florida-schools-300x168.jpg" alt="contact-sifu-och-wing-chun-florida-schools" width="300" height="168" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/24101329/sifu-och-wing-chun-florida-schools-300x168.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/24101329/sifu-och-wing-chun-florida-schools.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1383" class="wp-caption-text">Sifu Och&#8217;s Wing Chun Florida School</figcaption></figure></p>
<h2>Variations</h2>
<p>These two different variations of the punch represent either end of the spectrum. Karate and TKD on one side with Wing Chun Kung Fu on the other. Most other martial arts will fall somewhere in the middle of these punches. Tai Chi punching incorporates the relaxation to tense aspect associated with Wing Chun to the horizontal aspect of Karate/TKD. Whereas in Aikido, they do not focus as much on the techniques of the punch, rather using it as supplementary to other techniques. Muay Thai, Boxing, and Mixed Martial Arts, all utilize a punch called the jab. That is very similar to the Karate/TKD punch, but originates from a guard up by the temples and is more often used as an opening technique.</p>
<h2>Similarities</h2>
<p>Though each martial art may punch a little differently, there are a few concepts that are generally constant. One being to engage the core. Punches may be executed by the arm, but they come from the whole body. Likewise most martial arts will encourage putting hip torque behind punches to make them more effective and powerful. As well as a strong base through structure and rooting. Even though these fine points may be difficult to visibly discern, they are what makes any punch a good punch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One hit. Sometimes that&#8217;s all it takes. One well placed hit can end a fight. Power, speed, accuracy all come in to play. If you can accomplish that one hit, it can make the difference between making home alive, or not. You must use every advantage possible when defending your self. Wing Chun&#8217;s system of blocking and attacking at the same time is one such advantage. It allows you to disrupt the opponent&#8217;s timing and structure immediately. &#8220;Blocking and Attacking: 5 Moves For Disruption&#8221; will show you 5 moves you can use to gain the upper hand and hopefully land that one hit.</p>
<h2>Blocking and Attacking: 5 Moves for Disruption</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-8463 size-medium alignright" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104223/17949992_10212076512843196_1955888396_o-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104223/17949992_10212076512843196_1955888396_o-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104223/17949992_10212076512843196_1955888396_o-400x533.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104223/17949992_10212076512843196_1955888396_o-768x1025.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104223/17949992_10212076512843196_1955888396_o-450x600.jpg 450w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104223/17949992_10212076512843196_1955888396_o.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />Bui Sao Punch</p>
<p>The Bui Sao is going to be one of the most common moves to use in a self defense situation.The reason for this is the the hay-maker is one of the most used attacks by an untrained person. Swinging their arms by throwing their body weight causing a very wide attack. They leave their center wide open which allows one hand to press out and block the attack the second hand to fire straight forward at the assailant.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Tan Punch</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-8459 size-medium alignright" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104212/17917075_10212076512923198_254854088_o-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104212/17917075_10212076512923198_254854088_o-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104212/17917075_10212076512923198_254854088_o-400x533.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104212/17917075_10212076512923198_254854088_o-768x1025.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104212/17917075_10212076512923198_254854088_o-450x600.jpg 450w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104212/17917075_10212076512923198_254854088_o.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />The Tan Punch is a versatile technique. It can be use from the inside or the outside. Though not preferred, if an opponent uses a hook you can stop the hook with tan and then hit with the punch. If a straight punch is thrown you can redirect it to the outside or the inside depending on the circumstance. So, use it to smash through an attack, redirect a heavier one, or even break out of grips. Pressing from the front foot with the palm up and attacking with the other hand.</p>
<h3>Paak Punch</h3>
<p>The Paak Punch is a great tool to use when trying to quickly close the distance on an opponent or to transition from one side to the other. Use one hand to parry, or block an opponents oncoming strike. The other hand will deliver a strike either above or below the opponents arm. There are two ways to use the Paak. You can use it as more of a parry, deflecting the opponents strike off. Or, to completely stuff the punch back into them.</p>
<p>If the opponent is much taller than you it may be hard to reach their neck or head. Simply change your target to their rib and use the deflective Paak. Once you have hit their rib you can either come straight back up and strike the face with a palm. The pain in to the ribs causes the opponent to bend down allowing for this strike to happen. Otherwise, you simply paak his arm directly back toward his centerline, and punch is face.</p>
<h3>Jum Out Side Low Shadow Kick</h3>

Using a Jum Sao is a very effective tool to deal with the most powerful round houses. Press outward from the shoulder to the elbow. Both hands up creating a wall. With this Jum Sao set in place you can not only block the kick you can also kick out the base leg illustrated below.</p>
<h3>Quan Da Tong Kick</h3>
<p>A kin to the Double Jum Low Outside Shadow Kick is the Quan Da Tong Kick. The is done with a Low Bong Sao and a Tan Sao to block the roundhouse. Instead of kicking the leg the chest will be kicked. To do the Tong kick, tilt your foot inward and press with your heel, similar to a front kick. This strike is deliver right to the sternum. Block the opponents roundhouse properly and kick correctly, and you will send your opponent flying.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dit Da Jow Basics will explain what Dit Da Jow is and some of its uses. Dit Da Jow is an ancient Chinese healing liniment used both externally (rubbed onto the skin) and internally (ingested in small amounts). Externally it stimulates circulation in order to improve the healing of injuries as well as reduce pain and swelling. Internally it improves blood flow as well as Qi. One can improve its effects by applying the liniment before injury occurs. Such as in the case of conditioning or regular martial arts practice. If someone is throwing a punch at you, even an effective block can cause bruising. Many martial artists may consider bruises to be lesser injuries that will heal themselves; however, repeated injury to the same area may end up causing stagnant blood or Qi which may create greater problems later. The Dit Da Jow breaks up the stagnation and improves the overall health of the practitioner.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: medium;">Dit Da Jow Basics: Ingredients and Methods</span></h2>
<p>Often times the recipes for Dit Da Jow were well kept secrets and passed down through generations by oral or written tradition. Though these recipes for Dit Da Jow will vary greatly, some of the most common ingredients are:</p>
<p>Mustard Seed</p>
<p>Cardamom</p>
<p>Clove</p>
<p>Pumice</p>
<p>Cinnamon</p>
<p>Ginger</p>
<p>Safflower</p>
<p>Tumeric</p>
<p>Sulfer</p>
<p>Myrrh</p>
<p>Citrus Peel</p>
<p>Frankincense</p>
<p>Comphrey</p>
<p>Pine Bark</p>
<p>Peach Kernel</p>
<p>Camphor</p>
<p>Yarrow</p>
<p>Willow Bark</p>
<p>Cayenne</p>
<p>Mucuna Seed</p>
<p>Originally practitioners combined the herbs for the Dit Da Jow with rice wine and put the mixture into a clay vessel that was then buried underground. Today the ingredients above (as well as others not mentioned) are usually combined in various amounts with vodka or gin. The higher the percentage alcohol, the better the extraction of the herbs. As low as 80 proof vodka should be sufficient, but some people choose to use up to 190 proof vodkas. After combining the herbs with the alcohol, the mixture must sit for a minimum of three months. Though the mixture may have a better effectiveness the longer it brews. Many practitioners will allow their Dit Da Jow to sit for years before use.</p>
<p>The ingredients of this liniment often have either cold or hot effects on the body. A Dit Da Jow made up of warmer ingredients is more often used in conditioning and with chronic injuries. On the other hand, Dit Da Jow made with cooler ingredients is better suited for newer injuries with high inflammation.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: medium;">Uses</span></h2>
<p>To understand the use of Dit Da Jow on bruising, we must first understand what a bruise is. We all know that bruising happens when the body suffers a forceful blow or trauma of some kind. The skin then starts to turn different colors and becomes sensitive to touch or movement. This trauma sometimes causes small blood vessels to break, causing red blood cells to collect under the skin. Use of Dit Da Jow on a bruise can improve circulation and reducing stagnation of the red blood cells under the skin.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7406" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/24103521/wing-chun-history.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="216"></p>
<p>Dit Da Jow is also used to aid in the process of conditioning. Conditioning is a common martial arts practice that is often done by repeatedly striking a specific area of the body (i.e. shins, forearms, fists…) against something or someone. Practitioners will do this in order to make that area stronger and less susceptible to injury. Dit Da Jow can help in the conditioning process in two ways: applying proactively to reduce the likelihood of buising, and/or afterwards to speed the healing process.</p>
<p>Whatever the formula of used, or the reason for using it, Dit Da Jow still holds an important place in martial arts culture and practice. Not to mention the herbs make it smell fantastic and it is a great excuse to buy vodka.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ability to close the distance with an opponent is essential to any Wing Chun practitioner. You must be able to quickly respond to an opponents attack and shut them down to avoid follow up attacks. Different ranges call for different responses. That being said we will cover a few Wing Chun Entry Techniques here in this article. Before reading this article we suggesting checking out our previous article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/wing-chun-vs-jab-cross-hook-takedown/">Wing Chun Vs Jab, Cross, Hook Takedown Combo. </a>We explain the difference between committed and non-committed strikes which is essential to your training.</p>
<h2>Hand Entries</h2>
<h3>Paak Slip</h3>
<p>In our previous article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/wing-chun-vs-jab-cross-hook-takedown/">Wing Chun Vs Jab, Cross, Hook Takedown Combo</a> we touch on the idea of using the Paak to simply slip off the first punch. Connected is a video of Master Sifu demonstrating this technique. He explains how to utilize the Paak to deflect the initial blow and then glide off into a strike. A very effective and quick technique.</p>
<h3>Paak Punch</h3>
<p>The Paak Punch is a very effective combo to use. Instead of trading blow for blow with an opponent, the Paak Punch allows you to strike and defend at the same time. When countering a cross or straight punch this is a definite must. You are able to either crush a punch and counter above it with a punch of your own. Or, you can slip the punch and strike the ribs. Either way you are able to immediately counter straight punches and close the distance.</p>
<h3>Paak into Bui or Tan</h3>
<p>If an opponent does not throw a committed strike it can be very difficult to throw a counter. In this case it would be prudent to defect the first punch with a Paak and then counter the second punch. Two great choices would be either a Tan Punch or Bui Sao Punch.</p>
<p>A Tan Punch would be a great choice against any sort of straight punch. Since the Paak would have simply deflected the first punch you can use this as a set up for the second punch counter.</p>
<p>If he throws a haymaker or wide hook the Bui Sao Punch would be the best choice. The curved shape of the Bui Sao would match the trajectory of the hook allowing for maximum protection.</p>
<h2>Kick Entries</h2>
<h3>Shadow Kick</h3>
<p>If facing an opponent that moves a lot, pushing off the front foot, a Shadow Kick may be a option to consider. Our article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/kung-fu-kicks/">Kung Fu Kicks</a> goes into more detail about this kick. The idea is to crush into your opponents leg with a stomping motion. Typically aimed to blow out the knee the lead hand will typically drop as a result opening up an nice window for an attack.</p>
<h3>Crescent Kick</h3>
<p>Finally, the Crescent Kick. One of the most effective ways to use this kick is to the ribs when they extend their punch. This has the same shape as the Shadow Kick but instead of going down it strikes forward. You must thrust your entire body behind the kick. When this is done the head usually comes down as a result of the body caving into the kick. This allows for an easy strike to the head.</p>
<h2>The Key to Closing the Gab</h2>
<p>All of these techniques are futile if you do not close the distance with the right timing. You can only develop timing with hours of practice. Doing techniques in lines are a great way to build the structure for them and speed. However, if you do not consistently keep up your training your timing will be off an no amount of skill will help you if you do not time it correctly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a female martial artist of over a decade, I’ve noticed that women are generally treated differently than their male counterparts. This shouldn’t be a surprising statement and isn’t always a bad thing. Our bodies are structurally different, and those differences should be considered in certain situations. But not all, and certainly not most where martial arts is concerned. In this article,&nbsp;Women in Martial Arts, we will go over some of these considerations.</p>
<h2>When Gender Matters in Martial Arts</h2>
<p>Usually I tend to err towards equality in all situations, especially when it comes to training. But there are a few notable differences that should be addressed when a woman is training in the martial arts.</p>
<p>First off, the way that certain moves are performed may need to be adjusted – depending on the woman. For instance, many schools perform drills that require the non-punching hand to pull back with as much force as the punching hand. This sometimes results in the woman hitting her own breasts as hard as the object she is punching. Which may cause some women to have major problems performing the pull back of a punch due to breast size. On another related topic, breasts are unfortunately a very wide target area while sparring. Though most people at least try and avoid that area, there are always the unintended (or otherwise) slip-ups. Thankfully this can be easily rectified through the use of chest gear.</p>
<p>Another prudent difference is in the necessity of rape defense. Though male rape victims do exist, women are ten times more likely to be raped. This makes learning rape defense a good idea for anybody, but a necessity for women. This includes both wall defense and ground. Learning to escape from being pinned to the wall, or mounted from the ground. As well as education on warning signs and situational awareness.</p>
<h2>When it Shouldn’t</h2>
<p>While we have established that there are in fact scenarios where women should be treated differently, the vast majority of the time that is not the case. Too frequently are women partnered with men who “go easy on them,” thinking that they are doing the woman a favor. But what so many people don’t realize, is that every time a man “goes easy” or throws light punches, a woman doesn’t get to train. If women are only given the opportunity to train against easy punches, they will never be able to defend themselves.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7431" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/24103547/contact-us-sifu-och-wing-chun.jpg" alt="contact us, sifu och contact, contact sifu och" width="240" height="344" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/24103547/contact-us-sifu-och-wing-chun.jpg 240w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/24103547/contact-us-sifu-och-wing-chun-209x300.jpg 209w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></p>
<p>And there is also the consequence of having an inflated and unfounded sense of security. I once believed that I was an excellent grappler, because I was always able to defend myself against the guys I fought. I didn’t find out until later when some guy swept the floor with me, that they had been babying me the whole time. When I went back and talked to those same guys, and they were incredulous saying, “of course we went easy on you.” Which is all well and good until the day that I actually need to defend myself.</p>
<h2>My Perspective</h2>
<p>Being a woman in the martial arts, however, also has its advantages. Women tend to be more flexible, making them less prone to injury due to overextension or pulled muscles. In addition, their wider set hips allow for more mobility as far as performing kicks is concerned.</p>
<p>Martial arts throughout the years has evolved and changed to meet the needs of each generation. Although martial arts may be primarily a male dominant activity, women still make up a large percentage of its participants. In fact, Wing Chun was actually created by a woman. While she may have faced different struggles in the 17<sup>th</sup> century, we are all just looking to be able to defend ourselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Little 5 year old Lyla approaches me cry, &#8220;Mr. Tim, can I tell you something?&#8221; &#8220;Yes Lyla, whats the matter?&#8221; &#8220;That kid over there hurt me.&#8221; &#8220;What Happened?&#8221; &#8220;We were running and he made me fall.&#8221; &#8220;Do you think he did it on purpose? &#8220;No.&#8221; &#8220;Ok well then get back to jogging.&#8221; &#8220;But my finger hurts so bad.&#8221; &#8220;Did you know Lyla, that I hurt my finger really bad once when it got caught in a door?&#8221; &#8220;No.&#8221; &#8220;Here let me show you the scar.&#8221; Lyla stops crying. &#8220;Ya it hurt pretty bad&#8230;&#8221;; (I explain full story). &#8220;Yep, got 4 stitches; whats your favorite warm up?&#8221; Lyla cheerfully chirps, &#8220;Zombie Crawls&#8221;! &#8220;Ok lets do Zombie Crawls; everybody, Zombie Crawls!&#8221; In this article, &#8220;Cuts, Collisions, Crying: Tips for Your Kids Program&#8221;, I will explain how I handle children who are &#8220;distraught&#8221; over an injury.</p>
<h2>Cuts, Collisions, Crying: Tips for Your Kids Program</h2>
<h3>Know Your Kids</h3>
<p>Knowing your enemy is the first step in gaining the upper hand to defeat them. Obviously our children in our programs are not our enemies. However, overcoming their distress is. To use the technique I will explain you must know and understand your children. In my previous articles&nbsp;<a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/kung-fu-kids-keeping-your-kids-engaged/">Kung Fu Kids: Keeping your Kids Engaged</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/lakeland-afterschool-and-summer-camp-fun/">Lakeland Afterschool and Summer Camp Fun</a>&nbsp;I briefly mention a few ways to engage your children but also how to connect with them. Listening to them and not just treating them like a &#8220;little kid that is misbehaving&#8221; is a big key. When I speak to them if there was a fight or bad behavior I help them rise to the occasion. I tell them they need to speak to me like an adult. I help them calm their emotions. If they are excited or crying I explain to them I can&#8217;t understand what they are saying. Doing this usually helps them focus in on me and speak clearly.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-8732 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/24104418/IMG_4412-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/24104418/IMG_4412-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/24104418/IMG_4412-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/24104418/IMG_4412-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/24104418/IMG_4412-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/24104418/IMG_4412.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>By doing so I have seen an increase in respect when it is my turn to say something. By listening to them and explaining to them they must speak to me clearly they know that I am listening. This gains their trust as I watch and learn how they think and communicate. Once problem at a time I gain a little more insight into the differences that each child has. Once I know how their brain works, what they like, dislike, etc., I can now employ one of my favorite techniques when they are overreacting to an injury&#8230;distraction and redirection.</p>
<h3>The Art of Distraction and Redirection</h3>
<p>When a child is hurt their emotional flux tends to be more dramatic then the pain actually calls for. This is typically rooted in the base need for attention to have someone help with the problem. As they grow however, they need to learn that crying is not the best way to get help. But by clearing communicating with an adult. This is not automatically learned however, it must be taught. There is a hurdle when it comes to teaching this though. That hurdle is that emotional wave mentioned earlier. When their emotions are high, it is near impossible to teach them anything let alone communicate. Distraction is the key to breaking that emotional wall you will encounter.</p>
<h4>Distraction</h4>
<p>One of the best ways I have found to &#8220;distract&#8221; the child is connect with them by referring to one of your own injuries. Shifting the focus off of something requires something new to focus on. By relating to them with your own injury they will tend to perk up to hear the story. They want to know what happened to Mr. Tim and his finger and how he got that scar. Once the wave has been calmed by interesting anecdote, their attention must be moved forward or they will relapse into the &#8220;pain&#8221; which was mostly in their mind.</p>
<h4>Redirection</h4>
<p>Redirection is the next key. By moving their focus on something positive, something they enjoy (preferably within the activity being done) their carefree mind will happily get distracted by the next thing. In the story I gave Lyla the option to pick the next warm up. Turns her brain completely away from her finger to &#8220;ooo, I get to pick the next one, which one do I like&#8221;. Once this is done they usually go about the day without remembering their finger at all.</p>

<p>Know your children. Distract them when emotions are high. Then redirect them on to something fun and positive!</p>
