We are free to learn and educate ourselves in public while maintaining the traditions of the past \u201cwar like techniques\u201d with the protection in mind of our family, friends, and country. Modern Shaolin weapon training has a rich history. Traditional <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/wing-chun-butterfly-swords\/\">Wing Chun butterfly swords<\/a> resemble the butcher knives you might find in a kitchen today. They were&nbsp;something that may have been used to cut the heads off of fish in their time of concealment and may have looked unassuming since they didn\u2019t resemble the larger swords and <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/long-pole-weapon-fighting-or-dragon-pole\/\">long pole weapons<\/a> of their time. Today we respect these swords as additional weapons of empowerment, strength and the further extension of our Wing Chun fighting applications.<\/p>\n<p>We find that the training of both hands fighting as one increases your chances of survival as well as your full body fighting and survival applications. Even if you can&#8217;t find a pair of swords to fight with, two sticks, two axes, two hatchets, two machetes, a stick, and a knife much like in escrima\/kali can be used. Even if you only have one of them, since it is an extension of your body the stick, sword, knife, axe, hatchet or machete in the hands of a well seasoned and trained Wing Chun fighter is just scary. Wing Chun butterfly sword training doesn\u2019t use a lot of drills but rather repeated practice of fighting combinations against empty hand, long pole (8\u2019-12\u2019 dragon pole), short pole (6\u2019 monkey pole) and other sword types. This makes your training and execution of techniques extremely adaptable and practical in a real life situation.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/classes\/advanced-wing-chun-classes\/ip-ching-ip-chun-tampa-florida-wing-chun-school-chi-sau\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6756\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-6756\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/24102821\/ip-ching-ip-chun-tampa-florida-wing-chun-school-chi-sau1-300x198.jpg\" alt=\"Advanced Wing Chun combinations training\" width=\"300\" height=\"198\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/24102821\/ip-ching-ip-chun-tampa-florida-wing-chun-school-chi-sau1-300x198.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/24102821\/ip-ching-ip-chun-tampa-florida-wing-chun-school-chi-sau1.jpg 328w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a>Knife defense, gun, Stick, sword, long pole and Shaolin weapon training is all a part of the Wing Chun warrior\u2019s fighting regiment. A Wing Chun fighter must be well rounded and understand and beable to apply all that they know in the protection of family, friend, country or state. Though remember Wing Chun is a martial art of last resort, it teaches discipline, control, distance and self preservation. It also teaches you to be of calm mind and body and that if there is any chance you can leave or run while keeping your family safe then you are to do it. Though if your back is against the wall or if you can\u2019t leave safely Wing Chun answers the \u201cwhat if scenario\u2019s\u201d with a combination of realistic self defense and fighting combatives. We are here only to protect those we love and that includes ourselves, our training benefits all those we know, touch, love or even see. We are trained to do what is necessary to get us and those we love into a safe environment, out of harm\u2019s way when threatened or attacked. Wing Chun is a complete and full martial art comprised of techniques to empower the mind and body at any age of decisive development, all it takes it time, dedication and effort. Everything is available within your grasp, you can make it yours by being accountable for your training, your dedication and your time. There will always be a reason to wait, to do it later. Stop waiting in fear and take control of your accomplishments now and in the future.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today we enjoy the freedom of learning, training, sparring and fighting with these weapons without the fear of prosecution or imprisonment.
