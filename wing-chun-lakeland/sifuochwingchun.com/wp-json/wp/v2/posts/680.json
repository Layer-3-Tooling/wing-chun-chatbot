Our Lakeland Martial Art School is located in Polk County at 116 east pine street, Lakeland Florida<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><strong>Every&nbsp;Martial Art&nbsp;School is different, find out more&#8230;<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Every Wing Chun&nbsp;(Ving Tsun) school is different, look on youtube and you will see what I mean. I will speak about our school and our training methods for reference, this doesn&#8217;t mean your Ving Tsun school is wrong and we are right, or visa versa it only means that our lineage has&nbsp; a different teaching method and just like every teacher is unique, each instructor in the martial arts&nbsp; finds what is best for them and there students. When reading the articles on our site I want you to look at what is said and shown with a logical mind, a scientific mind and if after reading what is shown and said makes sense to you take it in, if not look at it deeper and subjectively and see what makes sense for you and your training . The way I train others is not far off from how I was originally trained, but the time and dedication that most students need to put in to get at the real heart of Wing Chun (Ving Tsun) or martial arts in general is not usually there on day one. Intense dedication over a proven period of time equals success and mastery, this as we know it is Kung Fu. How often do we hear people speak of there sons and daughters at the age of six or eight becoming black belts and how there children know and are equal to those adults of a similar rank and status running schools here and overseas. This is not intense dedication but rather a false sense of self and self-possibility, no matter what your age is, when you get your black belt you are still mastering the art. Depending on your age, the time you placed in the art, your intense dedication and the skill of your trainer will all determine your self-possibility or rather the possibility of self skill within and without. A trainer\/instructor\/master can only bring you to the pinocle of there ability, there limitations are your limitations but the limitations they place in the classroom will also limit your self-ability and skill through future training and practice. Literally you are only as good as your Master or as good as your Master is willing to teach you too. Teaching ability is your ability to be taught relies on you and your Master, if you are unwilling to listen and think logically through the techniques presented to you and absorb them you may be very difficult to teach. On the other hand you may find a Master that can show you he\/she has great skill and ability in there art but his five and ten year students don&#8217;t emulate this skill or ability. These instructors fall under a few categories, some are unwilling to part with the knowledge that took them half there life time to achieve or find and so they either don&#8217;t teach the full capabilities of there art or they teach it slowly.<\/p>\n<p>Others are more than willing to teach these abilities but there students but no matter how dedicated they may seem when they walk in the door, do not have the drive, time or will power in the beginning to do what is necessary to attain the true heart of the art they want to study. When these types of instructors try to push there students and intensify the training and build martial warriors there students complain about sore limbs and tough workouts and not having as much fun. This is a business decision, teach your students over time and then after three to five years we can try to give them<\/p>\n<p>When students come into there first class they have the potential for greatness, every student does, but will they quit if its too tough? Will they quit if the martial art takes time to learn?&nbsp; Will they give themselves the time they need to succeed? Many people ask how long till I&#8217;m a Black Belt\/Master in your Martial Art? My answer is, do you have any prior experience, how many days a week are you going (not just willing to train), how intense will you train when your here (do you just show up or do you push yourself)? Remember we get a &#8220;Master&#8217;s Degree&#8221; in 2-3 years when we have already&nbsp; graduated elementary school, high school, recieved an associates and bachelors degree. Education of the mind and body takes time, fortunately Wing Chun (Ving Tsun) does not take as long as many other martial arts to get to the higher levels.<\/p>\n<p>Over the years I have come to understand that the most people give up on themselves before they truly see their real potential. We take Wing Chun (Ving Tsun) and placed it into different stages allowing students to digest each piece as part of the greater whole. By allowing them them to see what higher level students are doing it drives at the heart of lower level practitioners to continue to push for the full understanding of Wing Chun (Ving Tsun) and what it means to have the complete art unchanged and how effective that truly can be for those students.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cResults happen by changing the path you have always taken.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Written by Chief Instructor;<\/p>\n<p>SIFU Justin Och<\/p>\n<p>(863) 800-0171<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\">https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Downtown Lakeland Kung Fu and Martial Arts<\/p>\n<p>Black &amp; Gold Sash in Wing Chun Kung Fu<\/p>\n<p>116 East Pine Street, Lakeland Florida<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Florida Wing Chun Schools \/ Florida Ving Tsun Schools&nbsp;and training methods Why is Our School of Wing Chun (Ving Tsun) Lakeland Martial Arts Different?
