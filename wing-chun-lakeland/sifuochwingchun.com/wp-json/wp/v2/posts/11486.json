I was only 5 years old when I got my first punch in the face. It is funny because I can still remember the whole situation quite vividly. I was going down a slide and thought everything was cool. There was a kid that was in front of me and once he got off the slide he turned around and hit me. <\/p><p>My mom did not raise me to be violent, so I started crying the moment his fist touched my face. My dad heard what happened and from there my Martial Arts career began. I was forced into a world that molded my character and played a significant role in the person I am today. I started with Karate and as time passed, I dabbled in other forms of combat like Boxing and different styles of Kung Fu.<\/p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1223\" height=\"818\" class=\"wp-image-11488\" style=\"width: 700px;\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/04144625\/IMG_7565.jpg\" alt=\"sifu justin och training student in wing chun kung fu technique\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/04144625\/IMG_7565.jpg 1223w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/04144625\/IMG_7565-800x535.jpg 800w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/04144625\/IMG_7565-768x514.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/04144625\/IMG_7565-400x268.jpg 400w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/04144625\/IMG_7565-600x401.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1223px) 100vw, 1223px\" \/><br><br>Every art form showed me different things that I can use to protect myself and my loved ones but out all of them <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/classes\/lakeland-wing-chun-kung-fu-classes\/\">Wing Chun<\/a> is hands down my absolute favorite. <strong>I have finally begun an art that I will never stop doing.<\/strong><\/p><p>Wing Chun is something that runs in my family. My uncle and father trained together when I was younger but the Sifu did not allow kids to join the class because the training was too difficult. I used to hate the fact that I could not attend class but in time life went on. I have wanted to learn Wing Chun for years, but life just kept getting in the way. One day last year I decided that enough time had passed, and I needed to make this happen. I went online and did some research. I found Orlando Wing Chun\/Sifu Och Wing Chun and read about the teacher and his teacher as well. I looked up the lineage of the school and did my best to get an understanding of what they were about. I was scared to join a school that was not authentic so I did my best to learn as much as I could. After my research was done, I reached out to the teacher via email and joined as soon as possible. My training has been nothing short of awesome. <\/p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1162\" height=\"818\" class=\"wp-image-11489\" style=\"width: 700px;\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/04144705\/IMG_7574.jpg\" alt=\"wing chun fitness student smiling at camera while in push up position on exercise mat\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/04144705\/IMG_7574.jpg 1162w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/04144705\/IMG_7574-800x563.jpg 800w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/04144705\/IMG_7574-768x541.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/04144705\/IMG_7574-400x282.jpg 400w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/04144705\/IMG_7574-600x422.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1162px) 100vw, 1162px\" \/><br><br>My instructors have been patient, understanding and extremely helpful. They have also inspired me to teach others when I am ready in the future so I can give people the gift that I have been given. Wing Chun has given me a newfound confidence in my ability to quickly de-escalate a physical altercation with minimal damage to myself. I have learned different styles throughout the years, but nothing is like Wing Chun. It is direct, straightforward and effective. <\/p><p>I honestly believe anyone with the will to learn can develop the skills that Wing Chun has to offer. I highly recommend this art form to any and everyone who wishes to protect themselves and their families. In my eyes, Wing Chun has saved my life because I am now much more prepared for any situation that may be presented to me. Knowing that you can protect yourself and others is a feeling that is indescribable and worth more than any currency that exist in this world.<br><br>In conclusion, I am forever grateful for the skills I am learning every day at Sifu Och Wing Chun. It truly feels like a family that I will continue to grow with and love more every day. I will continue to do my best to honor the efforts of my Wing Chun family and strive for excellence with everything I have in me and more.&#8221;<\/p><p>\u2013 Ian H.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">To learn more about our <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/classes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">self defense classes<\/a>, or our <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/lakeland-kickboxing-classes-fitness-bootcamps\/\">fitness bootcamps<\/a> here at Sifu Och Wing Chun, visit our <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/classes\/\">Classes Overview<\/a>.
