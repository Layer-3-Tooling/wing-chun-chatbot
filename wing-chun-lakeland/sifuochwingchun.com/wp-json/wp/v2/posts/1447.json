Not only in building a business but in finding practitioners willing to put in the dedication and time it takes to achieve usable advanced understanding and skill.&nbsp; On top of all of this a Master has to dedicate his life to teaching, exploring, paying and diving deeper into their own system to pass the full knowledge and not just what their teacher&#8217;s teacher taught them.&nbsp; This ensures that the next generation contains as much of the puzzle as possible and not just pieces.<\/p>\n<p>The terminology of Traditional Martial Arts has come with the thought that they are old, useless, rigid, dogmatic, cultist and hold the students mind and body down from further expansion or else they will dishonor there past masters and their sacrifices.&nbsp; Yet in almost every style of these \u201cOriginal Martial arts\u201d their masters were constantly looking into themselves, their fights and their styles so that they could become better.&nbsp; These old Master&#8217;s would seek out higher level instructors, train with them day in and day out until they completed the entire style and then after full understanding would incorporate these styles and fighting systems together.<\/p>\n<p>Survival, that was the only goal each original martial art was conceived for. That was why each style was created.&nbsp; These old instructors trained and traveled to uplift their ability to increase survival.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was only after this that Masters then took on students to support themselves and the survival of their communities.&nbsp; It has always been the goal of every original martial art instructor and every reality based martial artist to stick to these war and combat survival tactics.<\/p>\n<p>I wish to further understand the art and honor these past Masters and their sacrifice. Yet nothing can honor them more then becoming the best survivor of your art and diving deeper into the truth of it.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Want to join today contact us at;<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/contact-sifu-och\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/contact-sifu-och\/<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>For more info watch this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TNVHMpuZw3k\">videos<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">related images come from the Ip Man movies, bluraydatabase.co.uk, alternativechronicle.wordpress.com, gravitasventures.com, and the title image came from;
