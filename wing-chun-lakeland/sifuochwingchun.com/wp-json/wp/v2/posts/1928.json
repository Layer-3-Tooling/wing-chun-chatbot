When your child is bullied it can be psychologically destructive to their confidence, thought, concentration, and even how they conduct themselves in the future. A&nbsp;bully and bullying can consume a&nbsp;child&#8217;s every thought, from nighttime dreams&nbsp;to dreading the realities of the next school day.<\/p>\n<h2>Bully Self Defense Skills Aren&#8217;t Passive<\/h2>\n<p>Your child can try to ignore a&nbsp;bully, but this usually causes a bully to get more aggressive or confrontational.

Bully proofing your child with Sifu Och Wing Chun gives him or her&nbsp;increased confidence, self preservation skills, and self-assurance. Techniques to protect and keep your child safe during&nbsp;a physical confrontation is just one aspect of what we do, but we&nbsp;excel in the&nbsp;instruction needed to get results and keep your kids safe.

Our 11 year old was bullied last year at school to the point of needing counseling. His whole demeanor changed, and his grades went from A&#8217;s and B&#8217;s to C&#8217;s and D&#8217;s. At one point we weren&#8217;t sure if he was going to advance to the next&nbsp;grade\u2014all because of bullies. Eventually, we found Sifu Och Wing Chun and their kids martial arts program (which teaches bully self defense skills). After training here, our son is himself again, and he has his confidence back!&nbsp;Both our boys now&nbsp;attend the Wing Chun Lakeland&nbsp;Florida&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/kids-classes\/lakeland-after-school-martial-arts-program\/\">after school martial arts program<\/a>.&nbsp;I don&#8217;t think I could be happier with the program.<\/p>\n<p>Wing Chun is teaching our boys to be respectful and responsible. Sifu Och is a great role model. They are learning to think before they act and that with every action comes a&nbsp;reaction. I am very happy my husband and I found this program in Downtown&nbsp;Lakeland, and it&#8217;s so close to home. I would most definitely recommend the Wing Chun martial arts afterschool program to anyone looking for a great quality, safe, and affordable place for their children! &#8211; Debra H.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/24101653\/IMG_0859-e1353536841121.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright wp-image-1935 size-medium\" title=\"anti-bullying tip for parents florida self defense wing chun sifu och\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/24101653\/IMG_0859-e1353536841121-248x300.jpg\" alt=\"bully self defense skills from Sifu Och Wing Chun\" width=\"248\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/24101653\/IMG_0859-e1353536841121-248x300.jpg 248w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/24101653\/IMG_0859-e1353536841121.jpg 268w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 248px) 100vw, 248px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Anti-Bullying Tips for Parents<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Bullying is a real, constant threat. With today&#8217;s mass media, bullying no longer occurs in a just a limited&nbsp;local. With&nbsp;text and social media, bullying can be a 24\/7 scenario. It&#8217;s critical to listen to, and be aware of, what your children are&nbsp;exposed to. Their emotional suffering can last long after a bullying incident. Never say \u201cjust ignore it\u201d. Your child is talking to you for a reason\u2014listen. Be persistent until school administration or another parent takes action on your child\u2019s situation.<\/p>\n<p>Name calling, common in bullying, can lead to raised tensions and anger. Tell your child not to hit when called names or when verbally attacked. Bully self defense skills are only for stopping physical confrontations.<\/p>\n<p>A child should also never raise their fists unless it&#8217;s to protect themselves from bullying and forms of physical abuse. Teach them other ways to diffuse a situation, and let them know physical action is the<em> last<\/em> line of defense.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Just a few weeks ago&nbsp;I noticed the signs. As a Wing Chun martial arts instructor in the Sifu Och school, I know the signs of&nbsp;a child being bullied. I pulled both the brother and the sister aside to ask them if everything was ok. At first they looked at each other and said, &#8220;Yes,&nbsp;everything will be&nbsp;OK.&#8221; I&nbsp;asked <em>what<\/em> will be OK,&nbsp;only to find out&nbsp;that the sister had been slapped in the face on the&nbsp;bus and&nbsp;verbally assaulted. The brother had witnessed this, and though he was a top member of the wrestling team with a military father, he didn&#8217;t know what to do. I then found out he had been&nbsp;bullied in school as well and though&nbsp;he&nbsp;seemed confident around others he told me&nbsp;that at school he just tries to avoid being in the halls, and he&nbsp;has begun hating certain classes that he previously loved. When asked why they hadn&#8217;t told their mother (who is a wonderful&nbsp;woman), they said they were afraid they would get punished or blamed. Children, no matter how many times you talk to them and tell them to come to you, are not well-trained to do so. It sometimes takes an outside instructor or&nbsp;teacher who&#8217;s looking out for you and your family to help in these matters.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1939\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1939\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/24101655\/IMG_0900.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1939\" title=\"sifu och wing chun anti-bully kids bullyproof your child martial arts\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/24101655\/IMG_0900-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"sifu och wing chun anti-bully kids bullyproof your child martial arts\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/24101655\/IMG_0900-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/24101655\/IMG_0900-400x267.jpg 400w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/24101655\/IMG_0900-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/24101655\/IMG_0900.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1939\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">bullys are an everyday occurance for kids<br \/>what are you doing to protect your child?<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2>Anti-Bullying tips for Kids<\/h2>\n<p>Remember NOBODY has the right to make you feel bad or hurt you! Bullying includes, but is not limited to: Physical actions (pushing, kicking, punching), name calling, threatening texts or social media messages, rumors, or any means to upset and harm you\u2014do something!<\/p>\n<p>It is NOT your fault if you are being bullied. Tell a trusted adult or friend about the incident. Together, you can solve the issue or direct it to someone who can. If the first person you talk to can\u2019t help you, keep asking until you find someone who will help you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you can write down everything that has happened.<\/p>\n<h3>Things NOT to&nbsp;do!<\/h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t hide your feelings or what is happening from a trusted friend or adult. Secrecy is a bully&#8217;s biggest weapon, which is why they go through so much effort to keep you from telling someone.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t try and deal with a bully on your own. There is no fault in asking for help. With more people on your side, the bully can be brought to justice.<\/p>\n<p>Always tell the truth.
