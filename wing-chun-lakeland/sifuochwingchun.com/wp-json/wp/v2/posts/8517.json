Training in this art and the experience here has changed my life in ways I never thought that it would. Wing Chun is the first martial art that I have ever trained in. &nbsp;I used to practice boxing at the local Gold\u2019s Gym in Sebring. &nbsp;Though Wing Chun is completely different than anything I have ever trained in before.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>At first I was quite hesitant to drive 70 miles just to train in a martial art. &nbsp;Especially when there was plenty of choices such as Hapkido, Karate, MMA, and etc., very close to where I live.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>What I discovered from going here is that Sifu Och Wing Chun was the real deal with the&nbsp;techniques and training second to none.<\/p>\n<h2>My First Class with Sifu Och Wing Chun<\/h2>\n<p>Little did I know that after my first class at Sifu Och Wing Chun, I would be hooked and immediately begin to fall in love with Wing Chun. <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8536 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/24104258\/Wing-Chun-Lakeland-Florida-Kung-Fu-Deep-Patel-training-classes.jpg\" alt=\"my lakeland wing chun journey deep patel florida\" width=\"300\" height=\"216\">Not to mention all of the new friendships I would develop with the truly amazing group of people that also come in to train. Quite a while back, long before I started training at Sifu Och Wing Chun I used to have something of an ego. When it came to fighting and self defense I used to think that I would be good at defending myself without needing to train. Coming in to train at Sifu Och Wing Chun showed me that I was so terribly wrong. Seeing such powerful and highly skilled individuals train with little or no ego at all, was amazing. They didn\u2019t become upset when they were outmatched. &nbsp;Rather they chose to learn from their mistakes and improve their already high skillset. By spending time around my sihings and sifu, I have also adapted those qualities.<\/p>\n<h2>Advance my Self Defense Skills<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-8537\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/24104300\/lakeland-wing-chun-kung-fu-deep-patel.jpg\" alt=\"my lakeland wing chun journey deep patel florida\" width=\"300\" height=\"216\">Not only has my lakeland wing chun journey been to advance my self defense skills but also in many other parts of my life. I recently opened a business and many times I\u2019m outmatched by other businesses. &nbsp;I have learned to not let that bring me down and that letting go of my ego will allow me to adapt and grow. So that I am not outmatched both in the business aspect and personal aspect of my life. Humility takes a person much farther in life than ego ever can. I know that my journey has just begun and its not about the <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/kung-fu-belt-ranking\/\">levels, belts or sashes<\/a>. I also know that I will personally grow more due to this art. The positive influence that my peers and sifu provide uplift me more each day. Another amazing benefit that I have gained after training at Sifu Och Wing Chun is that I do not underestimate anyone anymore.<\/p>\n<h2>lakeland wing chun journey through Sifu Och<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8538 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/24104301\/best-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakealnd-fl-deep-patel.jpg\" alt=\"best wing chun kung fu lakeland fl deep patel\" width=\"300\" height=\"216\">An excellent aspect about Wing Chun that Sifu Och teaches is that its&nbsp;really simple to learn, but it becomes harder when we over complicate it. In a way life works in the same way. It really is simple to live life until we begin to overthink situations. Which causes unnecessary stress and worrying about something that might not even happen and that sets us back. It makes life complicated and harder to live. Through my time with Sifu Och I have learned that all aspects of life should be lived by the \u201cKeep it simple, stupid\u201d (KISS) principle. Sifu Och has the combined knowledge and training of 4 different <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/different-wing-chun-lineages-expanding-skill\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lineages<\/a> of Wing Chun. Making it a more realistic and hybridized style of Wing Chun taught by Sifu Och himself. This is probably the most realistic form of self defense that I have ever seen in my whole life.<\/p>\n<h2>lakeland wing chun journey is Not Over Complicated<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8539 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/24104303\/deep-patel-wing-chun-lakeland-journey.jpg\" alt=\"deep patel wing chun lakeland journey florida\" width=\"226\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/24104303\/deep-patel-wing-chun-lakeland-journey.jpg 226w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/24104303\/deep-patel-wing-chun-lakeland-journey-170x300.jpg 170w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px\" \/>You might get tired in class and you will definitely get in shape if you come consistently and push hard. What I love about Sifu Och Wing Chun is that&nbsp;the martial art is not overly complicated. It doesn&#8217;t have dozens of forms to remember for each possible situation. As a matter of fact there are only three main forms in the art. Even after training for many years a student can just master one of those forms. They can incorporate it properly into their<a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/worst-case-scenario-self-defense\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> self defense skills<\/a>. &nbsp;Yet still be much better off then someone who is taught tons of forms but can only use a few techniques from them. Even though I have strayed from my lakeland wing chun journey path once before I will try my hardest to make sure that I stay true to myself. &nbsp;I will continue to train Wing Chun, no matter how hard life gets.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe like me you need someone to convince you. Maybe you just watched the Ip Man movies but let me tell you Sifu Och Wing Chun is worth checking out. &nbsp;They are a family of friends and good times training realistic Wing Chun Kung Fu. &nbsp;It might save your life or just get you in shape. &nbsp;My lakeland wing chun journey continues, but the benefits are just waiting for you. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t know why your still reading, we should be in class training.<\/p>\n<p>I have recently accomplished my Orange Sash and wanted to share my thoughts and my Lakeland Wing Chun Journey with you.<\/p>\n<p>Written by <strong>Deep Patel<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>For information on classes contact us at<\/strong><br \/>\ncall us now at 863.800.0171<br \/>\n116 east pine street, lakeland florida 33801<br \/>\nWith classes 6 days a week for Adults, teens and kids ages 3 and up.<br \/>\n<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/classes\/lakeland-wing-chun-kung-fu-classes\/\">https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/classes\/lakeland-wing-chun-kung-fu-classes\/<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My lakeland wing chun journey This is my lakeland wing chun journey.
