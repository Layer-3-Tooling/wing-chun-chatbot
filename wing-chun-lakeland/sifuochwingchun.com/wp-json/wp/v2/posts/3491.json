It may not be up-front and obvious, but all fighting styles utilize movements, systems, and methodologies that can be broken down into force, leverage, inertia, angles, and power. If that&#8217;s not science\u2014well, we don&#8217;t know what is. So it makes perfect sense that we&#8217;d want to break down the science of Wing Chun to see what exactly is going on when you throw a tan zhao punch or counter an opponent&#8217;s leg. Wing Chun is most certainly&nbsp;a realistic as well as scientific arrangement of combat. So&nbsp;how much of science does Wing Chun contain?<\/p>\n<h2><b>How scientific is Wing Chun Self Defense<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>From the human anatomy point of view, Wing Chun observes that the groin, throat, eyes and many of our other key susceptible targets all perch down the centerline of our body. Due to this and several other causes we invariably assault and oppose all attacks along the middle.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Follows Geometry axiom<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>An adage in geometry states \u201cthe shortest distance between two points is a straight line.\u201d &nbsp;It&#8217;s for exactly this reason that Wing Chun practitioners forever strike as well as defend directly in front of, and all along, the center. As an alternative of parrying first and then striking back, a Wing Chun student will concurrently block as well as a hit\u2014even when&nbsp;the opponent&nbsp;is mid-strike.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Physics in wing chun self defense<br \/>\n<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>A law&nbsp;of physics states that&nbsp;&#8220;two objects cannot occupy the same space at the same time.&#8221;&nbsp;With this in mind, the science&nbsp;of Wing Chun self defense, at all times, aims to constantly engage the center line with punches&nbsp;in addition to kicks, conceding to and redirecting all obstructions. It also&nbsp;persistently substitutes the&nbsp;arms back transversely via the center line. As soon as you&nbsp;are able to control the center in Wing Chun, you&nbsp;can feel as well as take advantage of your challenger\u2019s under- and over-committals by means of sticky legs or hands sensitivity.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Follows triangle or pyramid in structure<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>The triangle or&nbsp;pyramid is the firmest shape in nature. Realizing this, Wing Chun frequently applies in its arrangement as well as movements&nbsp;in&nbsp;triangles in addition to 45\/60 degree angles. For instance, when training, Wing Chun has you&nbsp;stand somewhat pigeon-toed with knees curved in and with both arms pulled out\u2014creating 3 triangles by means the&nbsp;our arms, legs, and&nbsp;feet.<\/p>\n<h3><b>45 or 60 degree angle to deflect<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>When parrying or even attacking, Wing Chun&nbsp;makes use of the control of 45 or 60 degree angles to ward off, pass on and cut across an opponent&#8217;s defenses. If substantial force is aimed at at the&nbsp;centerline, then Wing Chun&nbsp;&#8220;triangle evades&#8221; and moves forward at 45\/60 degrees, letting you move&nbsp;beyond your initial&nbsp;location by means of not brute power or muscle, but merely the control of angles.<\/p>\n<h2><b>The SCIENCE OF Wing Chun IS truly a science of self-defense<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>There are quite a lot of other examples in addition to the reasons why Wing Chun really is the science of self-defense. It&#8217;s sufficient to say that by taking into consideration characteristics of anatomy, geometry, kinesiology, and physics, Wing Chun self defense is more of a martial science than an art. In fact, the application (along with the workouts and training forms) is&nbsp;the &#8220;art&#8221; part of the martial art, while the &#8220;science&#8221; is subconscious in addition to second-nature, implanting the muscle-memory, memorizing to control the opponent\u2019s power, thereby productively expressing yours.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Every classic and modern combat system is based in science.
