With an increase in dual-income families and single parent homes, these after school programs have become a necessity for a vast number of families. This has created a great demand for after-school care programs; however, all programs are not created equal. Parents have many options to choose from in picking an after school program and the amount of time the child spends at that program makes it an incredibly important decision, so what makes a good program? <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"_5yl5\">Sifu Och vs Other After-Care Programs <\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span class=\"_5yl5\">Most after school programs have a singular focus with only one program to offer. Our children have the opportunity to learn both martial arts and dance. Let&#8217;s face it: children have very short attention spans. The opportunity to attend two completely different aftercare programs every week allows for a greater ability for them to learn and enjoy themselves. The two skills of dance and martial arts in themselves are invaluable. The dance classes teach coordination, flexibility, and self-expression. While the martial arts classes teach children discipline, respect, and to defend themselves. As well, children in both classes will learn a number of skills that teachers cannot explicitly teach in the classroom. Some of the additional skills taught include: etiquette, manners, team building, organization, social interaction, and cleanliness. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"_5yl5\">Curriculum <\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span class=\"_5yl5\">Sifu Och Wing Chun and Just Dance offer a unique program curriculum that encourages both personal growth and learning. We place children into different classes based on age. The older children working on Wing Chun Monday&#8217;s and Wednesday&#8217;s while the younger children follow Just Dances program. On Tuesday&#8217;s and Thursday&#8217;s the older kids go to Just Dance and the younger ones do kickboxing. We offer kickboxing to the younger children instead of Wing Chun, as it is a little bit easier for them to comprehend and practice. In the Wing Chun classes, we teach children the same curriculum that adults learn throughout the week; including punch and kick defenses, forms, and combinations. The kickboxing classes incorporate a mixture of principles from Wing Chun, Karate, and Boxing all done in a kid friendly class. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7254\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/24103329\/best-polk-county-summer-camp-girls-sifu-och-wing-chun.jpg\" alt=\"best summer camp in lakealnd fl, best summer camp in lakeland florida, best summer camp, lakeland, fl, florida, sifu och wing chun, kung fu\" width=\"300\" height=\"216\"><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"_5yl5\">The Just Dance classes teach dance from a variety of styles including: Ballroom, Ballet, and Hip Hop. Summer Camp is also offered along with the regular school year after-care. In summer camp kids will continue taking martial arts and dance. They will also participate in a plethora of activities to keep them busy. Activities range from museums to amusement parks to arts and crafts, and are all monitored by an attentive staff. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"_5yl5\">Lifelong Benefits <\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span class=\"_5yl5\">The benefits gained from our after school program reach beyond the immediate. They have the potential to greatly affect each child\u2019s future. We give these children valuable time to be physically active and interact socially with their peers in a way that their school is unable to provide for them. Being active in the younger years has the potential to decrease the likelihood of various diseases and boosts immunity, allowing for a healthier future. It may also have the ability create fewer emotional and behavioral problems. At Sifu Och Wing Chun, our program also strives to instill good leadership qualities in the children. Rewarding leadership in students and encouraging success by positive reinforcement. An investment in your child&#8217;s future, is always worth the effort. This investment made early on will have lifelong physical and cognitive benefits, make sure it&#8217;s a good one.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sifu Och Wing Chun and Just Dance offer a unique program curriculum that encourages both personal growth and learning.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":11,"featured_media":6784,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[3,11],"tags":[17,21,32,136,576,583,1025,1143,1706],"class":[2029],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Why Sifu Och Wing Chun After-School Program?
