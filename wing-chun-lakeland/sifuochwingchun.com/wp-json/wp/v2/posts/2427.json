However, the techniques will still suit you if you are planning on learning&nbsp;full range kicks, joint locks, grappling or ground work.&nbsp; As Wing Chun Kung Fu is an adaptive self defense system based on quick reaction at any range.<\/p>\n<h2>Training<\/h2>\n<p>Since Wing Chun focuses on reaction versus hundreds of forms without a partner a practitioner learns quicker than in most systems.&nbsp; Wing Chun Kung Fu also takes a considerably shorter time to learn and master when compared to other Chinese fighting styles and&nbsp;Gung Fu systems.&nbsp; The techniques trained at Sifu Och&#8217;s Lakeland Kung Fu training camps and school in downtown lakeland fl will take anyone of any background to new levels.&nbsp; This will prove to be ideal for anyone who simply wishes to learn the best techniques for self-defense or engage in healthy physical activities without the need to devote the next 20 years before mastering their skills and achieving something great.<\/p>\n<h2>Control<\/h2>\n<p>An important rule taught by Wing Chun Kung Fu lakeland fl is being in control of what is called the \u2018center line\u2019, which is the space between you and your opponent.
