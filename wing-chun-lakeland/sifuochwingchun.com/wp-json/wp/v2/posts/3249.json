Even the most innocent stumble from the bar to the late-night kebab shop or burger joint can be fraught with danger for the unwary and unprepared.&nbsp; Professional training in martial arts and self-defense, such as that on offer at the Wing Chun Kung Fu Academy, could not only make all the difference next time you\u2019re confronted by such a situation, but can also lead to a whole host of benefits for the body and mind.<\/p>\n<p>self defense is a concept developed and taught at schools like the Wing Chun School, which will enable you to avoid or effectively deal with any aggressive situation that may arise. The martial art courses at Wing Chun School will teach you invaluable techniques to aid you in spotting trouble before you walk into it, putting-off potential attackers through your demeanour, and \u2013 as a last resort \u2013 neutralizing an attack in a manner that has little chance of leading to a full scale brawl or landing you in trouble with the authorities.<\/p>\n<h2>Wing Chun Kung Fu Academy<\/h2>\n<p>Courses on offer at the Wing Chun Kung Fu Academy provide comprehensive training in the Wing Chun system, developed over 300 years ago and passed down through many generations, blending the techniques of several masters.

Through taking a course like those provided by Wing Chun Academy, you will learn that self defense does not necessarily involve fighting at all, but can be as much about remaining calm, relaxed and hard to upset, exuding confidence so as to avoid being drawn into a fight in the first place. The martial arts techniques taught by Wing Chun instructors will allow you to remain unruffled in the face of an aggressive onslaught and you never know who you might end up impressing with your James Bond-cool attitude.<\/p>\n<p>Knowledge of self defense is a real asset in modern society and you can\u2019t get a better grounding than that offered by the Wing Chun School \u2013 so why not check out the website to find your nearest Kuen and set out down the road to becoming an imperturbable master of the arts now?<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Written by Wing Chun Fans of Sifu Och<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With the rise in violent crime seen over the last decades, it is becoming an increasingly canny idea to invest in some training in self-defense.
