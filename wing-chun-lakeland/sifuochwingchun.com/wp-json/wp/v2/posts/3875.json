Then&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;immediately punch off. That is the way to break an arm and a leg simultaneously.<\/p>\n<p>If I were to try and kick the opponent\u2019s forward leg, head on, with my&nbsp;right there is not only the possibility of him resisting your attack, you would be putting your balance at&nbsp;risk as well as limiting the potential for success of your attack. If I was to kick with my other leg, the chances of causing serious&nbsp;harm to him would be higher, but you would want to have enough distance between you and him&nbsp;because he will more than likely throw a punch with his other hand (since the other is immobilized).<\/p>\n<h2>Remember, You Don&#8217;t <em>Have<\/em> to Break an Arm and a Leg<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s actually okay if the kick wasn&#8217;t successful because you can instantly come off, move in, and break his defense. Remember, you&#8217;re <em>attempting<\/em> to break an arm and a leg simultaneously\u2014it doesn&#8217;t mean you have to succeed at both. If I was to repeat the scenario (going for an arm break as well as kicking in for a fractured femur&nbsp;simultaneously), you are likely&nbsp;going to end up completing one of the two. If an attacker&nbsp;was to punch at me, I&#8217;m&nbsp;either going to break the arm then kick, or I\u2019m going to pull and kick. You could&nbsp;continue on, breaking the arm with his\/her elbow towards the outside, but this&nbsp;would best&nbsp;be accomplished&nbsp;by someone&nbsp;truly adept&nbsp;at Wing Chun. You can, however, add onto it in other ways. After the kick, if you were to pull the attacker&nbsp;to the ground, twisting the opponent&#8217;s arm could easily result in it breaking.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Dynamic Kicking Structure | Realistic Self Defense | Sifu Och Wing Chun\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/qNG1ubCDo0I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In Wing Chun, if I\u2019m going to kick, I\u2019m going to kick towards an opponent&#8217;s&nbsp;centerline\u2014perpendicular towards his right patella.
