Krav Maga Wing Chun are the best martial arts.There are martial art programs that will pat you on the back, hand you a black belt in a few years and not teach you how to get out of a wet paper bag (just in case you ever get stuck in one).&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Krav Maga Wing Chun<\/span><\/span> is a type of self defense martial arts.

Wing Chun schools such as Sifu Och&#8217;s Wing Chun school in Lakeland, Florida, Wong Shun Leung Ving Tsun schools in Europe such as Philipp Bayer&#8217;s are great street self defence schools.&nbsp; These guys teach these knock out street fighting Wing Chun aspects as well but from real serious scenarios such as home invasion, parking lot, and bar scenarios. Though Krav Maga also teaches a lot of scenario techniques as well such as chokes, bear hugs, knife attacks, and shirt grabs.&nbsp; The same type of scenarios are in both Wing Chun and Krav Maga and they both want you to just react, react, react or laugh out loud&#8230; attack, attack, attack!&nbsp; The best offence is a amazing defence right, Wing Chun and Krav Maga have both! Both of these street fighting and self defence styles teach how to knock out or kill in the advanced levels.&nbsp; Both Kra v Maga and Wing Chun were developed for war and real street self defence.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Krav Maga or Wing Chun?&nbsp; I personally would recommend Wing Chun unless you live in a area of the world that has been torn asunder by war or terrorist.&nbsp; Not to mention that Wing Chun has aspects that suit every age and size, drills and applications that can keep you advancing into your 80&#8217;s and 90&#8217;s. Wing Chun&#8217;s fast rooted and structured attacks will increase your self defence while in a family environment. I would also say that in my opinion Wing Chun is better for day to day street self defence in most countries as they focus on the close quarters of practical fighting.&nbsp; I personally in all my years have never been approached in a street fight by guys carrying automatic weapons and bullet proof vests.&nbsp; If I did, I get out of there first before I said hmm time for my Krav Maga or Wing Chun training. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/24101007\/sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu-takedown-fighting-sparring-florida-schools.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-837\" title=\"sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu-takedown-fighting-sparring-florida-schools\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/24101007\/sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu-takedown-fighting-sparring-florida-schools.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"184\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/24101007\/sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu-takedown-fighting-sparring-florida-schools.jpg 350w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/24101007\/sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu-takedown-fighting-sparring-florida-schools-300x158.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" \/><\/a>Just make sure you find a Wing Chun instructor that is really focused on knock out combinations, real street self defence versus the forms and intense theory\/slapping hands\/and lots and lots of history.&nbsp; <\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Make sure where ever you are you let your instructor know your goals, tell them you want real street self defence and fighting combinations.&nbsp; Let them know you want to push yourself towards a higher level of street self defence protection.&nbsp; If they know and they teach it, you will love it!

I left out MMA (mixed martial arts) cage training as there are many rules and the street has none, though it is very effective I would have to say most schools do not cover knife, gun, stick or reality situations that may be encountered on the street.&nbsp; Such as you get a guy to the ground and he pulls out a knife or hey, lets just say he is standing and trying to cut you&#8230; when did your MMA (mixed martial art) coach go over that for the ring?&nbsp; I am leaving out Jeet Kune Do as I love the practice and idea&nbsp;but finding someone that actually has a root in Wing Chun teaching it is getting near impossible. Wing Chun was hailed by Bruce Lee as the huge fighting engine for JKD (jeet kune do).&nbsp; To hear some JKD instructors actually say&nbsp;Wing Chun doesn&#8217;t need to be learned as part of the system is like saying&nbsp;pressure and close contact&nbsp;shouldn&#8217;t be part of&nbsp;Jiujitsu&nbsp;.&nbsp; It&#8217;s hard to admit but most of the JKD (jeet kune do) instructors I have seen now only have a understand of&nbsp;boxing, muay thai, some jiujitsu and&nbsp;some takedowns, which is unfortunate.&nbsp; If a JKD (jeet kune do) school is missing a big handle on using and understanding the Wing Chun fighting aspect then I would have to say its more MMA than Bruce Lee JKD. With much love and no disrepect I stick with my choices of Krav Maga Wing Chun as truly devastating stand up striking street self defence martial arts.&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For more info watch this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6C2BD8_hqjY\">videos<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Krav Maga Wing Chun Best martial art Which is the best martial art for street self defence Choosing the best martial arts program that fits your overall physical, intellectual, wants and desires can be a tricky thing.
