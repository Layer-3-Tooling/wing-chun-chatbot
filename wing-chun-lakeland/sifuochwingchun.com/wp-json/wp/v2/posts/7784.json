Options range from eBay to online courses in&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/marketing\/wing-chun-kung-fu-classes\/\">Wing Chun Kung Fu<\/a>,&nbsp;Brazilian Jiujitsu, or&nbsp;a host of other styles. In this day and&nbsp;age, it can be as easy as paying a fee, taking&nbsp;some online courses, and getting your Instructor level sash. Do you consider online certified sifus&nbsp;to be real,&nbsp;genuine teachers? We don&#8217;t. If one&nbsp;opens a school and begins teaching, how do students know if this is the best&nbsp;person to give their money to? We have some suggestions.<\/p>\n<h2>Online Certified Sifus &#8211; Would You Like Fries With That Sash?<\/h2>\n<p>Is there a real check and balance on these online certifications? Are they truly doing any real training? Or, are they simply \u201cbuying\u201d their certification and then coming out the other end as a \u201ccertified\u201d Wing Chun instructor? Online certified sifus represent an unfortunate, growing, problem in martial arts.<\/p>\n<p>My sifu, <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/instructors\/sifu-justin-och-chief-wing-chun-instructor\/\">Sifu Justin Och<\/a> was trained in person by each of his Masters through weekly group classes and private lessons. Typically, I have a hard time believing that you can get the same full understanding without touching the hands of an advanced instructor on a weekly or even daily basis. However, does that mean that online Wing Chun training can&#8217;t be beneficial? No,&nbsp;but&nbsp;getting &#8220;certified&#8221; as a Sifu through online training&nbsp;doesn&#8217;t seem to be worth&nbsp;much more than the paper it comes with.<\/p>\n<p>We can all agree it&#8217;s getting too easy to buy your way (or even fraud your way) into everything from certifications to Hall of Fames. But does that make online training certifications and weekend seminar courses &#8220;fraudulent&#8221;? Does this make your <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/is-your-sifu-a-fraud-or-the-real-deal\/\">sifu a fraud<\/a>? That depends on what questions you&#8217;re asking, and what answers you&#8217;re getting in return.<\/p>\n<h2>Do Your Research<\/h2>\n<p>Some instructors are out for the rank, but they aren\u2019t willing to put in the years of work, time, effort, and devotion to truly earn their title. <strong>Do your research.<\/strong> Don\u2019t be afraid to run a background check on your potential instructor. You need to know who you&#8217;re going to be devoting yourself to as your sifu. Be informed, and don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions.<\/p>\n<p>If your sifu\u2019s certifications are reputable, then the next thing you need to look at is how the instructor teaches. Some martial arts instructors have been trained extremely well, but are not gifted with the ability to communicate that training to others. This is an unfortunate situation. It&#8217;s not going to be a productive environment for you if you cannot learn or properly understand the techniques. Unfortunately, some instructors try to hide this lack of teaching ability by having their assistant instructors teach the classes. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask who actively leads the classes that you&#8217;re interested in taking. If you&#8217;re paying for a quality sifu level instructor to teach you, then be sure that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re getting.<\/p>\n<h3>Personal Training and Improvement<\/h3>\n<p>If you can see your sifu is qualified with legitimate certifications and has the gift to be able to teach others, then the next thing I would look for is how the Sifu trains and keeps his own skills sharp. If I&#8217;m seeking <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/testimonials\/wing-chun-training-family\/\">Wing Chun training<\/a> from an instructor, then I expect my sifu to take his <em>own<\/em> training seriously. Does he still train on his own to keep his skills fresh? Does he meet periodically with other sifus so they can&nbsp;exchange ideas and learn from each other? If your sifu is still showing personal motivation and devotion to his own development and growth in Wing Chun, then he will be able to pass this same dedication on to you!<\/p>\n<h2>Digging Deeper<\/h2>\n<p>I did the same thing I&#8217;m telling you now before I began training with my instructor, Sifu Justin Och. I checked his background\u2014all of it. Next, I contacted the people he got his sifu level from. Finally, I even checked on his overseas visits with other grandmasters and instructors.<\/p>\n<p>After my research, I have no doubts that my&nbsp;Sifu, Justin Och, is the real deal. He was not trained online. Sifu Och&nbsp;was trained in person through weekly group and private lessons for many years. He was tested and certified under master\u2019s from 4 different <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/ip-man\/\">Ip Man Wing Chun<\/a> lineages (Moy Yat, Ip Chun, Ip Ching, and Simon Lau) after years of arduous training according to his master.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldvingtsun.com\/schools.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">World Ving Tsun Athletic Association<\/a>, a group of Wing Chun Kung Fu masters and grandmasters appointed him as the Regional Director for the Southeastern USA. Sifu Och&nbsp;trains in Jui-Jitsu with black belts in BJJ and has had a professional MMA fighter and black belt in BJJ as his coach for years. Sifu Justin Och has traveled to <strong>11 countries<\/strong> seeking out the full understanding of Wing Chun Kung Fu. This is on top of being <strong>three times certified as a Sifu<\/strong> in the Wing Chun system.<\/p>\n<h3>International Training<\/h3>\n<p>His travels have expanded his own Wing Chun training, and he brings that training back home to his Lakeland, Florida students. He has even met and rolled Chi Sao hands with Ip Chun (eldest son of Ip Man).<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7813\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7813\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-7813 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/24103731\/Sifu-Justin-Och-Ip-Chun-Ip-Man-son-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Sifu Justin Och Ip Chun Ip Man son\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/24103731\/Sifu-Justin-Och-Ip-Chun-Ip-Man-son.jpg 800w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/24103731\/Sifu-Justin-Och-Ip-Chun-Ip-Man-son-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/24103731\/Sifu-Justin-Och-Ip-Chun-Ip-Man-son-400x267.jpg 400w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/24103731\/Sifu-Justin-Och-Ip-Chun-Ip-Man-son-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/24103731\/Sifu-Justin-Och-Ip-Chun-Ip-Man-son-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-7813\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sifu Justin Och training Chi Sau overseas with Ip Chun, eldest son of legendary Wing Chun Master Ip Man<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Sifu Justin Och is by all means the real deal when it comes to Wing Chun.
