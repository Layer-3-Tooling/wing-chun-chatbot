This proves to be highly effective in a controlled environment of martial arts competitions, but can become limiting and predictable when faced with a real danger of violence on the street.<\/p>\n<h2>Difference Between Wing Chun and Jeet Kune<\/h2>\n<p>Bruce Lee had perfected Wing Chun Kung Fu moves through years of training and regarded them highly, but also believed that they can be improved to better reflect the chaos and unpredictability of street fighting.
