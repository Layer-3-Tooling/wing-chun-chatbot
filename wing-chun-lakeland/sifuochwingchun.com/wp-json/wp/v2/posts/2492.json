Blocking and attacking simultaneously while shifting and moving to get out of the way of incoming attacks.&nbsp; Instead of using force against force Wing Chun Gung Fu has proven counter strategies that take power from the assailant and truly use it against them.&nbsp; Instead of using force versus force where a smaller practitioner of Wing Chun Gung Fu might fall victim Wing Chun uses dynamic footwork and redirective combinations that take the assailants line of power out of the equation.Wing Chun Gung Fu power is one of the most exceptional martial art systems out there.<\/p>\n<p>For every line of power there are four lines of weakness this means that a smaller and weaker fighter can quickly stop and drop a larger and stronger assailant.Wing Chun Gung Fu power is one of the most exceptional martial art systems out there.&nbsp; A Wing Chun stylist uses their heads to avoid direct confrontation and uses the assailants strength, force and power against them.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;a struggle of power can only happen between two individuals both willing to struggle &#8211; Sifu Justin Och&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>If one individual decides to strike instead of struggle the battle of strength against strength is turned.Wing Chun Gung Fu power is one of the most exceptional martial art systems out there.&nbsp; Fight smarter not harder my Master use to say.&nbsp; Within Wing Chun there are a lot of concepts and many concetrate on the concepts of Wing Chun versus the ability to use Wing Chun Gung Fu in a dangerous, stress induced, pressured situation.&nbsp; What many may not realize is that it only takes a small amount of strength to redirect a line of power, though this is not to say that Wing Chun Gung Fu does not use strength or power.&nbsp; In fact a practitioner of Wing Chun Gung Fu, if properly taught is told to focus on knockout power with speed but never speed over knockout power.&nbsp;&nbsp; This takes a practitioners mindset away from just fast and fancy movements and pulls them into the reality of combat, knocking or incapacitating their assailant.<\/p>\n<p>Because speed comes so fast to a Wing Chun Gung Fu practitioner many forget to train in its follow through power.&nbsp; This makes it so that even a weak Wing Chun practitioner can stop, move and break the timing and body down of a much larger assailant if the weaker Wing Chun Gung Fu practitioner is taught to follow through.Wing Chun Gung Fu power is one of the most exceptional martial art systems out there.&nbsp; Each strike is an opportunity to stop the fight as a practitioner does not want a long drawn out battle.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Longer fights have to many factors involved from weapons being drawn, accomplices joining, to draining endurance and stamina.&nbsp; Ending a fight quickly also minimizes damage to all parties involved. &#8211; Sifu Justin Och&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Training and pushing yourself to fight five rounds for five minutes is a great goal, but then using all that stamina to end the fight quickly without burning yourself out but rather staying calm in the moment is key.<\/p>\n<p>Wing Chun Gung Fu power is one of the most exceptional martial art systems out there.&nbsp; The ability to quickly counter, move, attack, redirect, and defend against so many other techniques and systems of combat.&nbsp; Wing Chun Gung Fu is a proven tried and true system of realistic self defense.&nbsp; If you want the power, the strength and ability Wing Chun gung fu power provides you have to train like an a animal.&nbsp; You have to train hard, push hard, under pressure and resistance.&nbsp; In order to gain realistic self defense you have to train it just like any other athlete, just thinking about it or doing it passively will gain you a passive response when under attack.<\/p>\n<p><strong>to start your journey contact <a href=\"mailto:sifuoch@facebook.com \">sifuoch@facebook.com <\/a><\/strong><br \/>\nSifu Och Wing Chun in downtown lakeland florida martial arts<br \/>\nBlack and Gold Sash Wing Chun Gung Fu Power<br \/>\nlakeland florida gung fu power martial arts<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com \">https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com <\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Struggling Wing Chun Gung Fu Power One of the very first things that is taught within the system of Wing Chun Gung Fu is to use all of the bodies weapons for both offense and defense.&nbsp;
