Wing Chun, one of the&nbsp;primordial fighting arts of the Chinese, actually developed from quite a lot of other fighting styles approximately 360 years ago\u2014following the end of the Ming Dynasty. The objective was to build up a very efficient fighting&nbsp;system&nbsp;which could produce competent warriors within a very short span of time so as to protect against the foreign policies and affronts of the Qing Dynasty.<\/p>\n<p>Born from this was the&nbsp;very real self defense system of&nbsp;Wing Chun. Anticipating responses as well as taking into account body placement and leverage, the Wing Chun combatant assaults while maintaining&nbsp;self-protection. From the beginning, students of Wing Chun are trained in a very advanced approach that involves a&nbsp;plan of attack. At the same time,&nbsp;they will be able to control the attack of the opponent, turning however strong an initial attack into a&nbsp;less effective effort.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Trained to face situationS WITH real self defense wing chun<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>The students of Wing Chun are trained to meet every option that could perhaps come about in a real self defense Wing Chun situation. The concurrent use and working of hands, arms, and&nbsp;legs are exercised at the most basic and direct level. Using your eyes and quickly reading the actions of an&nbsp;opponent also forms a fundamental part of the Wing Chun response. A very significant feature of Wing Chun as part of a real self defense program is the timely and accurate perception of your opponent&#8217;s response. Students of Wing Chun, even at the very beginning, are taught to interpret precise attacks, right up to real contact. This is how Wing Chun lets you&nbsp;work your entire body as a single unit, helping&nbsp;to conclude a defensive situation in a jiffy.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Become experts in real self defense wing chun<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Students&nbsp;of Wing Chun are provided training so they can become experts in self-defense from all remoteness. In fact, the physical requirements&nbsp;for the real self defense style of Wing Chun plays only an inferior role. By means of the greatly formulated sensibilities trained via Chi Sao (that is,&nbsp;binding arms), Wing Chun combatants can instantaneously acclimatize to any potential attack. The principal rule in Wing Chun, in addition to the objective of the training, is not to linger &#8220;sticking&#8221; in place. Consequently, a student can perfect the execution of each single movement\u2014metamorphosing&nbsp;the Wing Chun pupil into an individual who is extremely efficient and able to defend himself\/herself with tremendous agility. With the real self defense tactics of Wing Chun, all elements of the body\u2014as well the mind\u2014respond instantly and independently of each other&nbsp;in short time. This is because&nbsp;the path of the information flow is cut down, helping&nbsp;you to react very quickly. They&#8217;re able to consider the level of danger in front of them and react accordingly\u2014and&nbsp;quickly.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A real self defense system needs to be based in a rich and proven heritage.
