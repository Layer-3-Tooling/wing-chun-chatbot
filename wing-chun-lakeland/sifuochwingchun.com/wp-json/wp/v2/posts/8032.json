Fencing, Iaido, and Kendo are the&nbsp;few which do. Fencing revolves around the use of the rapier. Iaido Practitioners utilize the katana. Finally, similar to Iaido, Kendo&#8217;s training involves preparation for the use of a Katana with a Shima. Here in Kendo&#8217;s History, we will focus on the history of Kendo&nbsp;including&nbsp;its origins as a 2 part series. In Part 2, we will change our focus to its practice.<\/p>\n<h2>KenDo&#8217;s Meaning<\/h2>\n<p>Kendo structures its art around the Japanese sword. Coincidentally, Kendo&nbsp;derives its name from the same. \u201cKen\u201d is the Japanese character meaning sword, and \u201cDo\u201d is the character meaning way or path.&nbsp;Kendo is literally translated as \u201cThe way of the sword\u201d. Like <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/marketing\/wing-chun-kung-fu-classes\/\">Wing Chun kung fu<\/a>, the exact origin of the art is unknown, and its history does not link back to any founder. Based on historical studies, the&nbsp;history of Kendo stems from kenjutsu (the art of the sword) over several centuries. Both swordsman and Samurai played key roles in keeping it alive.<\/p>\n<h2>HISTORY of Kendo<\/h2>\n<p>Like Kendo, Kenjutsu&#8217;s origin is uncertain. The&nbsp;history of Kendo can, however, be traced back to the Heian period (794-1185). During that time its congruent years allowed the Samurai to perfect their sword techniques. The martial art was not highly sought after until the late Muromachi period (1336-1568). At that time,&nbsp;a long civil war ensued and resulted in the establishment of more Kenjutsu schools. After the turmoil in the early years of the Edo period (1603-1867), the concept of kenjutsu underwent a change. The techniques of the art initially focused on killing. Setsunin-to (the life-taking sword) eventually changed to the&nbsp;opposite: katsujin-ken (the life-giving sword). Katsujin-ken focused not only on swordsmanship but also on the discipline of one\u2019s inner-self. Swordsman published many books relaying their theories on swordsmanship. One notable work is Musashi Miyamoto\u2019s \u201cThe Book of Five Rings\u201d.<\/p>\n<h2>Modern Kendo<\/h2>\n<p>Modern kendo did not take its form until the Shotoku era (1711-1715). Naganuma Shirozaemon Kunisato of the Jiki-shinkage-ryu school improved on the use of the <i>bogu<\/i> (armor) as well as the shinai (bamboo sword). He also&nbsp;established a shinai training method. In this continuing era of peace many Samurai established schools (dojos), teaching their art of kenjutsu or traveling from region to region honing their skills in inter-school competitions. Of the many schools during the Edo period in the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century, three schools became recognized as the \u201cThree Great Dojos of Edo\u201d. These included Renpeikan led by sinsei Saito Yakuro, Shigakken led by sinsei Momoi Shunzo, and Genbukan led by sinsei Chiba Shusaku. Several of Chiba\u2019s techniques are still practiced today.<\/p>\n<h2>Kendo&#8217;s Rise<\/h2>\n<p>With the rise of the Meiji Restoration in 1868, and the abolition of the Samurai, the practice of kenjutsu witnessed a drastic decline. It was not until after an unsuccessful resistance movement on the government in 1877, that&nbsp;the government noticed the benefits of kenjutsu. It began&nbsp;teaching the practice to its Tokyo Metropolitian Police. The forming of the Dai-Nippon Butoku-Kai organization in 1895 allowed for the nationalization of the practice of kenjutsu. The rapidly growing popularity of&nbsp;Kenjutsu&nbsp;soon demanded a universal form. After careful deliberation between schools, Kenjutsu masters created the Nihon Kendo Kata, a set of kendo regulations.<\/p>\n<h2>Kendo Resurrected<\/h2>\n<p>Kendo and its practice remained uninterrupted into World War II, where the occupying allied forces saw kendo as undemocratic. They also saw it as&nbsp;having militaristic associations and outlawed the practice. This&nbsp;also resulted in the disbanding of the Butoku-kai organization. The Ban did not last long. The All Japan Kendo Federation revitalized Kendo with its founding in 1952. The Federation changed Kendo to take the shape of a &#8220;pure sport&#8221; martial art which was vital to its resurrection. The focus shifted from combat to the development of mind and body with the purpose of obtaining a better life for oneself. Furthermore, since the establishment of the International Kendo Federation in 1970, Kendo has made a popular appearances globally with many people wanting to practice the art.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The history of Kendo stems from kenjutsu (the art of the sword) over several centuries, and was kept alive by both swordsman and Samurai.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":12,"featured_media":8045,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1874],"tags":[249,1706,1912,1913],"class":[2027],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>History of Kendo - The Way of the Sword - Sifu Och Wing Chun<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"The history of Kendo stems from kenjutsu (the art of the sword) over several centuries, and was kept alive by both swordsman and Samurai.\" \/>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/history-of-kendo\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"History of Kendo - The Way of the Sword - Sifu Och Wing Chun\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"The history of Kendo stems from kenjutsu (the art of the sword) over several centuries, and was kept alive by both swordsman and Samurai.\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/history-of-kendo\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Sifu Och Wing Chun\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:publisher\" content=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sifuochwingchun\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2016-12-16T13:00:55+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:modified_time\" content=\"2020-09-07T02:11:42+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/24104007\/History-of-Kendo.jpg\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:width\" content=\"800\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:height\" content=\"516\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:type\" content=\"image\/jpeg\" \/>\n<meta name=\"author\" content=\"Ben Devris\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:creator\" content=\"@SifuOchWingChun\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:site\" content=\"@SifuOchWingChun\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Written by\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"Ben Devris\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:label2\" content=\"Est. reading time\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data2\" content=\"3 minutes\" \/>\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/history-of-kendo\/\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/history-of-kendo\/\",\"name\":\"History of Kendo - The Way of the Sword - Sifu Och Wing Chun\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/#website\"},\"datePublished\":\"2016-12-16T13:00:55+00:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2020-09-07T02:11:42+00:00\",\"author\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/#\/schema\/person\/d2fd3e4d03db26cddf9d29d979a16327\"},\"description\":\"The history of Kendo stems from kenjutsu (the art of the sword) over several centuries, and was kept alive by both swordsman and Samurai.\",\"breadcrumb\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/history-of-kendo\/#breadcrumb\"},\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"ReadAction\",\"target\":[\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/history-of-kendo\/\"]}]},{\"@type\":\"BreadcrumbList\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/history-of-kendo\/#breadcrumb\",\"itemListElement\":[{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":1,\"name\":\"Home\",\"item\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":2,\"name\":\"Articles\",\"item\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/category\/articles\/\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":3,\"name\":\"Techniques and Styles\",\"item\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/category\/articles\/techniques-styles\/\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":4,\"name\":\"History of Kendo &#8211;
