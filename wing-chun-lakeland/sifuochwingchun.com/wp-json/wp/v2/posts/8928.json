Since your eating the right foods and healthy foods your going to do just fine.&nbsp; You have meal prepped and the food is ready to go so eat it when your hungry.&nbsp; Make sure you drink plenty of tea and water throughout the day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Eating poorly is a habit, so is eating healthy.&#8221;<br \/>\n<\/strong><br \/>\nLose weight fast and healthy by eating grilled, boiled, or baked vegetables and lean meats every day.&nbsp; If your already fit add in non-processed carbs like brown rice, oats, and earth made carbs.&nbsp; If your not fit and looking to lose weight then only vegetables and lean meats for you.&nbsp; &nbsp;You must cut out all sugars, carbs that don&#8217;t come from your vegetables, bread and milk products.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do I drink?&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\nWithout sugar or artificial sweeteners you can drink tea, BCAA flavored drinks, water, and coffee.&nbsp; If you must flavor your drinks use natural sweeteners like stevia.<\/p>\n<h2>STEP 3 &#8211; BODY &amp; COLON CLEANSE<\/h2>\n<p>You can take a body and colon cleanse at any time in the beginning of the diet or when you hit a plateau.&nbsp; When cleaning out your body I prefer something that is gentle, doesn&#8217;t contain senna, and also rids the body of parasites and micro-organisms.&nbsp; &nbsp;After this its a good time to take some probiotics and revitalize your immune system.<\/p>\n<h2>STEP 4 &#8211; KEEP IT UP<\/h2>\n<p>Weigh yourself once a week and keep it up.&nbsp; To lose weight fast &amp; healthy on the OX DIET you have to have a strong will and stay away from temptation.&nbsp; When you start seeing those results don&#8217;t celebrate yet.&nbsp; Keep it up and push through till you get everything you wanted in your weight and body needs.<\/p>\n<h2>WORK OUT<\/h2>\n<p>Cardio is great but you need to lift weights as well.&nbsp; So as you lose weight, lift weight.&nbsp; Find a <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/cardio-lifting-and-martial-arts\/\">martial art class,<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/classes\/lakeland-kickboxing-weight-loss-bootcamp\/\">kickboxing<\/a>, find a gym where you will keep pushing each week to reach your goals.<\/p>\n<h2>INTERMITTENT FASTING<\/h2>\n<p>You don&#8217;t eat for 16 hours and then eat all your food in a 8 hour window.&nbsp; &nbsp;Intermittent fast means you eat all your food and calories for the day in a 8 hour period and then only drink tea, coffee, and water for the rest of the day.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can pick what ever 8 hours during the day is good for you.&nbsp; Though remember once your time starts you can&#8217;t break up that 8 hours.&nbsp; Its 8 hours straight of time to eat your healthy meats and veggies and then only tea, coffee, and water.<\/p>\n<h2>AFTER I HIT MY GOAL WEIGHT<\/h2>\n<p>So you lose weight fast but what happens when you get to your goal weight?&nbsp; At that point you should be adding in more carbs from oats, brown rice, fruit, and earth made carbohydrates.&nbsp; Giving yourself a cheat day once a week is also a great Idea.&nbsp; This helps to throw your body off and gives you a break to eat foods that give your life pleasure and you work off later!<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">ALMOST NO SUGAR or CARBS<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Vegetables have a bunch of sugar and carbohydrates already in them, check out this link <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fatsecret.com\/calories-nutrition\/food\/vegetables\/carbohydrate\">https:\/\/www.fatsecret.com\/calories-nutrition\/food\/vegetables\/carbohydrate.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/a>Which means your food should contain all you need.<\/p>\n<p>Vegetables also have tons of vitamins in them check out this link&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.lenntech.com\/fruit-vegetable-vitamin-content.htm\">https:\/\/www.lenntech.com\/fruit-vegetable-vitamin-content.htm<\/a><\/p>\n<p>So don&#8217;t fret about not taking in those sugary drinks, candies, cakes, fruits, chips, and dairy products your going to do great.&nbsp; So remember no sugar, no dairy, no carbs that don&#8217;t come from vegetables and no bread.<\/p>\n<p>So if your worried you won&#8217;t get in enough sugar, carbs, or vitamins on the diet you are going to do just fine.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">NO YOU can&#8217;t HAVE IT on the &#8211; OX DIET<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t reached your goal weight, you can&#8217;t have the below at all.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>no sugar at all (not even fruit in until your goal weight is reached.)<\/li>\n<li>no carbs at all (unless from vegetables until your goal weight loss is reached.)<\/li>\n<li>no dairy at all<\/li>\n<li>no bread at all<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you want to lose weight fast, First you will lose weight fast if you stop taking in sugar (yes even from fruit), carbs from non-vegetable sources, bread and calorie drink products.<\/p>\n<p>So why do diets restrict your calorie intact, make you feel like your starving while body builders eat 6-9 times a day and look like Demi-gods?&nbsp; Calories are the fuel or gas of your body, so if your wanting to have your metabolism run at full tilt you need fuel.&nbsp; Though there is a huge difference in what kind of fuel.<\/p>\n<p>My Diet is hard, you can lose weight fast but it will test your will power and you will want to cheat.&nbsp; Those who don&#8217;t cheat get the prize of great weight loss and a healthier body, those who do cheat (yes, even a little now and again) before they get their goal weight will not attain everything they are after.<\/p>\n<p>If you want a rocky up and down fad diet this isn&#8217;t for you.&nbsp; If you would rather do something easier that won&#8217;t test your will power pick another diet and come back when your really ready.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em>WARNING &#8211;&nbsp;I am not a doctor.&nbsp; consult your doctor before doing this diet.&nbsp; THIS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This diet is not forever, you will lose weight and then train yourself to eat in moderation.&nbsp; Eating without heavy amounts of carbs, sugar, and dairy in your life.&nbsp;<\/em><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>lose weight fast &amp; healthy &#8211; OX DIET We at Sifu Och Wing Chun created the OX Diet which is basically eating clean and lean all day.&nbsp; Lose weight fast and healthy with this premise&#8230; you fuel your body by consuming good leans meats, good fats, and vegetables for fiber, vitamins and carbs.&nbsp; By only [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":8931,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[9],"tags":[531,540,551,1698,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012],"class":[2028],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>lose weight fast &amp; healthy - OX DIET - Sifu Och Wing Chun<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"OCH Diet is meat and vegetables.\u00a0 Lose weight fast and healthy by fueling your body by consuming good leans meats, good fats, &amp; vegetables.
