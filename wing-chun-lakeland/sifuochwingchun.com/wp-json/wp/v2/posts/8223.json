Though that is not a worst case scenario for self defense, in our experience 98% of martial arts studio&#8217;s teach for a friendly environment that caters to uplifting a family fun atmosphere, most people want to feel confident but not go through hard and real ways to cause massive damage to another person. &nbsp;When it comes to training special forces and military personnel they&nbsp;taught how to deal real damage to&nbsp;enemy combatants.<\/p>\n<h3><em>&#8220;the Sifu Och Wing Chun studio, this article and its writer do not advocate violence, this piece is for information only.&#8221;<\/em><\/h3>\n<h2>Unrealistic Self Defense for a&nbsp;worst case scenario<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-8230\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/24104050\/lakeland-worst-case-self-defesne-florida-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu.jpg\" alt=\"worst case scenario self defense lakeland florida sifu och wing chun kung fu\" width=\"300\" height=\"216\">When its <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/when-its-life-or-death\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">life or death<\/a> the decisions and training you make matter. &nbsp;In my experience less than 5% of people train worst case scenario self defense with the dedication and intention on personal survival. Most people think about weight loss, fitness, having fun in the martial arts over practical realistic training. Some people love the competitive sparring but even more people attempt to ignore that there is danger and choose not to think about it and therefore hope it never happens. Even worse when those same people are asked about a bad situation most believe they will miraculously have the skill and ability to stop a real attack which means they couldn&#8217;t be more wrong and unprepared for one. Even trained self defense practitioners wouldn&#8217;t believe this is possible.<\/p>\n<p>Ordinary individuals can find themselves in danger and if you can&#8217;t get away, run, or escape by another fashion then the most efficient reaction could clearly save your life. Circumstances against a citizen on the street may be less extreme than those in war but the threat to your life and future is no less real. Even if you are hospitalized then the loss of money, time, and skill could heavily impact you and your future. &nbsp;Proven Training comes down to the instruction and your diligence in pushing yourself even <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/wing-chun-proved-self-defense-part-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wing Chun Self Defense<\/a> has to be used in tested to be effective, many schools may do drills but real information may escape them.<\/p>\n<p>Ordinary people might have to stop a drunk with a weapon or a mugging especially if you can&#8217;t escape. or prevent the event from progressing. Situational awareness is another weapon in your arsenal to give you a pre-awareness of what may be around you.<\/p>\n<h2>Is your Training realistic for a worst case scenario<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8232 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/24104053\/worst-case-self-defesne-lakealnd-florida-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu.jpg\" alt=\"worst case scenario self defense lakeland florida sifu och wing chun kung fu\" width=\"300\" height=\"216\">You must train for all ranges of possibilities to deal with low and high level threats. This is just one difference in the reality of worst case scenario self defense training under a instructor. &nbsp;Most of these questions expect you to be truly honest with yourself and what kind of instruction your receiving.&nbsp;There is a huge difference between Martial Arts and Realistic survival of a worst case scenario self defense.<\/p>\n<p>Finding a real school to train in can be hard, ask yourself these questions.<br \/>\n1.) Are you&nbsp;training alot of hand&nbsp;forms, fancy applications, or touch sparring?<br \/>\n2.) Can you stop someone from aggressively attacking you?<br \/>\n3.)&nbsp;Is your instructor training you in truly realistic techniques?<\/p>\n<p>Many people have a hard time being objective with their martial arts training as they get attached to the &#8220;idea&#8221; of their studio or school and the people there. But remember why you started and what your trying to achieve.<\/p>\n<h3><em>&#8220;the Sifu Och Wing Chun studio, this article and its writer do not advocate violence, this piece is for information only.&#8221;<\/em><\/h3>\n<p>Sifu Justin Och<br \/>\n11 Countries Traveled<br \/>\nContact us at 863.800.0171<br \/>\nRegional Director for World Ving Tsun Association in charge of entire Southeastern USA<br \/>\n3x certified and tested as an Ip Man lineage Sifu<br \/>\n116 E. pine st, lakeland FL 33801<br \/>\nFan page \u2013 <a href=\"http:\/\/Http:\/\/facebook.com\/sifuochwingchun\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Http:\/\/facebook.com\/sifuochwingchun<\/a><br \/>\nWebsite \u2013 <a href=\"http:\/\/https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Worst Case Scenario Self Defense In a worst case scenario&nbsp;the best and most useful tools at your discretion are violent aggression, self confidence in your ability, and the will to do whatever is necessary to survive. &nbsp;These are weapons that can only be disarmed by you and are carried with you everywhere you go at [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":8238,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[9],"tags":[1960,1975,1974,1973,1972,1971,1970,1969,1968,1967,1966,1965,1964,1963,1962,1961,17,1959,1958,1957,1885,1863,1143,980,699,136,105,23,22,21,18],"class":[2027],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.1 -
