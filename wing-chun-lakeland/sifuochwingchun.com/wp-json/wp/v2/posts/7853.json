I came into <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/marketing\/wing-chun-kung-fu-classes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wing Chun classes<\/a> with a swarm of new people. Immediately, a swarm of colored shirts and sashes overloaded my senses. The first few months simply delivered&nbsp;a shocking mix of&nbsp;strange movements and the excitement of starting a new martial art. With no previous exposure to martial arts, I amazed&nbsp;myself using simple techniques to block punches. Punches that would not have truly&nbsp;made impact. Moving forward almost two years, I received my green sash and blue shirt. The most important roadblock that I had to overcome involved&nbsp;developing the student&nbsp;mindset behind learning Wing Chun. Without this student mindset, no&nbsp;student will never be successful. Anyone can practice&nbsp;sloppy techniques, but until you&nbsp;develop the student&nbsp;mindset, your martial arts&nbsp;training&nbsp;will never reach the depths of appreciation and effectiveness it deserves.<\/p>\n<h2>Developing the Student Mindset Quickly is Key<\/h2>\n<p>After attending&nbsp;the school for just two years, I&#8217;ve seen hundreds of people walk through the doors and&nbsp;never come back. This usually occurs within the first 6-12 months. They come, participate, and walk away thinking they have studied Wing Chun. The truth, however, is that they have simply been <em>exposed<\/em> to Wing Chun. Far too many people make the mistake of associating&nbsp;<em>exposure<\/em>&nbsp;to Wing Chun with&nbsp;actually&nbsp;<em>training<\/em>&nbsp;in Wing Chun. The crucial difference lies in the mindset of the student. When a person has developed this correct mindset, they truly begin to train.<\/p>\n<p>For the first time ever, after developing this mindset, the student will push their hardest.<\/p>\n<h2>What is the Student Mindset?<\/h2>\n<p>This student mindset goes above simply just reproducing various techniques across various lines done in class. This mindset is about making every single thing you do in class<em> matter<\/em>. <em>How<\/em> you train, is how your Wing Chun becomes programmed into your reactions. When you step into class, you are surrounded by an incredible wealth of knowledge and skill. The only thing that can keep you from becoming your best is&nbsp;yourself. Very few people come into this school with the right mindset, but everyone can develop it. The choice is yours. I believe this mindset develops into 4 things: Sweat, Perfection, Blood, and Tears.<\/p>\n<h3>Sweat<\/h3>\n<p>You can\u2019t succeed if you don\u2019t push yourself. These techniques will not mean anything if you just throw them out there and hope for the best. No techniques ever will. When I began developing through the very beginning ranks, I noticed that the upper sashes always seemed to be dripping in sweat. The rest&nbsp;of us were barely out of breath though, we complained about our arms being sore. I then realized that this was even the case when they were doing the exact same thing we were doing. I soon realized that this difference was due to how they trained. The more advanced the student, the harder they trained. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they could punch harder, but rather, they would give it everything they had.<\/p>\n<p>A line that a lower student would do looks lazy in comparison. After a few lines, the upper sash would be breaking out in sweat. This doesn\u2019t at all relate to their endurance, but specifically relates to how they are training. This same exact illustration can apply to workouts. When assigned to&nbsp;give 500 chain punches into the focus mitts, the&nbsp;easy method&nbsp;rushes through without giving much focus&nbsp;behind the strikes. You probably won\u2019t even break a sweat. But what if, instead of just faking your way through the 500 attacks, you made every single one of those punches as hard and fast as you could? By the end of it, you\u2019d be dripping in sweat. How much more did you gain from those same 500 punches? If you\u2019re not sweating, you can be sure you\u2019re not working your hardest.<\/p>\n<h3>Perfection<\/h3>\n<p>There becomes a crucial difference between giving a technique everything you got while still doing the technique, and just hitting as hard as you can. When you are drilling techniques, your focus should first be on perfection. If you train a&nbsp;particular block 100 different times, but 50 of them are&nbsp;sloppy, then when you draw from that \u201creflex pool\u201d you have a 50% chance of successfully completing that technique. In other words, you have a 50% chance of getting hit by a knockout punch. Those are not the odds you want to be training. When you first learn a combo for example, of course you aren\u2019t going to remember everything. You\u2019re going to have to think about what comes next. So it is important to slow it down for perfection.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t ever excuse a repetitive mistake. If it\u2019s sloppy, if it feels rushed, or if something seems off, fix it. If you don\u2019t know how, ask. There is a wealth of information around you, so use it. Don\u2019t allow yourself to train imperfection. You have to learn how to balance power with perfection. If you go too hard or fast and lose the precision of perfection, you\u2019ve failed to perform the technique. You can perfectly perform and land a technique but fail to make it have damaging power. That means you&#8217;re just&nbsp;tapping your opponent.&nbsp;Neither of these does you any good.<\/p>\n<h3>Blood<\/h3>\n<p>You have to accept the fact that you\u2019re going to be hit. You\u2019re going to bruise. If you can\u2019t perform your techniques against resistance, then they&#8217;re not where they need to be. If you can use it against someone punching you, how can you defend yourself? It should also be noted that you are learning a new martial art: including your own body. This goes above just reproducing a technique. You have to condition your body for this art. It won\u2019t necessarily be the greatest feeling in the world, but if your arms can\u2019t hold up to training, they won\u2019t when you need to defend yourself. Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean that this school is a brutal death cage like gladiator school.<\/p>\n<p>The same thing goes with working out. You are going to get sore lifting weights; you might accidentally drop weights on your feet; you will be exhausted; or you could pull muscles. If you\u2019re too afraid of being hit, or you want to train without being hit, then you\u2019re not training an art to defend yourself. You\u2019re going to get hit. It&#8217;s how you learn to protect against that hit the next time. I get hit every day, usually multiple times, but it doesn\u2019t bloody up my face or break my bones. If you\u2019re not training against true resistance, you will never know if what you\u2019re doing actually works. Here, I know what works. I know what I\u2019m training works because I can prove it.<\/p>\n<h3>Tears<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019re not as good as you think you are. You\u2019re going to struggle with some things. You\u2019re going to feel like quitting. You\u2019re going to want to stay home and relax instead of coming to class. You\u2019re not alone in any of these feelings. Every single person above you has felt this way multiple times. The question is whether you are going to push through it or not. It comes down to you. It\u2019s not going to be easy, but you can certainly do it. Just keep pushing. Never give up.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>I wasted the first year of Wing Chun training without this student mindset and regret it. When I truly started to develop this mindset, my training exploded. I never felt as close to my Wing Chun family as I have now. I crave each day for the information I get. I am able to better accept my shortcomings because they will help me to be better. Tests are no longer something that I worry about, because I have trained it hard from day one of each rotation. Test days are incredibly fun. Train, and train it with everything you got. Push yourself, and encourage others to push. It\u2019s going to be hard, but it is so worth it.<\/p>\n<p>You will gain so much by training the right mindset. Don\u2019t be afraid to fail because you\u2019re going to. The only difference between a master and you is that they\u2019ve trained it in the right mindset and failed more times than you have even attempted.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Anyone can practice sloppy techniques, but until you develop the student mindset, your martial arts training will never reach the depths of appreciation and effectiveness it deserves.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":9,"featured_media":7856,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[10],"tags":[59,1603,1686],"class":[2027],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Developing the Student Mindset - Sifu Och Wing Chun<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Anyone can practice sloppy techniques, but until you develop the student mindset, your martial arts training will never reach its potential.\" \/>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/developing-the-student-mindset\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Developing the Student Mindset - Sifu Och Wing Chun\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Anyone can practice sloppy techniques, but until you develop the student mindset, your martial arts training will never reach its potential.\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/developing-the-student-mindset\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Sifu Och Wing Chun\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:publisher\" content=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sifuochwingchun\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:author\" content=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Corbett00atc\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2016-10-10T12:00:49+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:modified_time\" content=\"2020-09-07T02:14:26+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/24103757\/Developing-the-Student-Mindset.jpg\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:width\" content=\"800\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:height\" content=\"533\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:type\" content=\"image\/jpeg\" \/>\n<meta name=\"author\" content=\"Andrew Corbett\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:creator\" content=\"@SifuOchWingChun\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:site\" content=\"@SifuOchWingChun\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Written by\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"Andrew Corbett\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:label2\" content=\"Est. reading time\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data2\" content=\"7 minutes\" \/>\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/developing-the-student-mindset\/\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/developing-the-student-mindset\/\",\"name\":\"Developing the Student Mindset - Sifu Och Wing Chun\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/#website\"},\"datePublished\":\"2016-10-10T12:00:49+00:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2020-09-07T02:14:26+00:00\",\"author\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/#\/schema\/person\/f2b7140794cadee1922f626f244256f6\"},\"description\":\"Anyone can practice sloppy techniques, but until you develop the student mindset, your martial arts training will never reach its potential.\",\"breadcrumb\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/developing-the-student-mindset\/#breadcrumb\"},\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"ReadAction\",\"target\":[\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/developing-the-student-mindset\/\"]}]},{\"@type\":\"BreadcrumbList\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/developing-the-student-mindset\/#breadcrumb\",\"itemListElement\":[{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":1,\"name\":\"Home\",\"item\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":2,\"name\":\"Articles\",\"item\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/category\/articles\/\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":3,\"name\":\"Wing Chun Theory\",\"item\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/category\/articles\/wing-chun-theory\/\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":4,\"name\":\"Developing the Student Mindset\"}]},{\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/#website\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/\",\"name\":\"Sifu Och Wing Chun\",\"description\":\"Kung Fu and Martial Arts for Kids &amp;
