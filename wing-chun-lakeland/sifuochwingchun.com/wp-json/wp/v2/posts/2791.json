Better to see and know that the school your in is exactly what you want before you join and dedicate a life time of passion. At the Gainesville Dojo you can explore multiple systems under one roof. Though many may find it unbelievable that they wouldn&#8217;t mind you trying, training and attempting several classes under several different Masters before dedicating yourself the Gainesville Dojo does exactly that.<\/p>\n<p>Owner Keith Teller, Hanshi is a teacher by day and makes sure that everyone knows that even if you are training with him and feel as though switching to a different system would be better for you, he just wants you training. Since there are so many instructors under one roof you have a large variety of martial arts to pick from. Though my personal belief is that dedicating yourself, your time and effort should be a course not taken lightly.<\/p>\n<p>If you find a system that fits your fighting style and methods stick with it, master it and become exceptional at it. Chasing and training under many systems at the same time can not only confuse you but also hinder your Mastery, reaction and understanding.<\/p>\n<p>The Gainesville Dojo is an assortment of systems and masters but once you find one or two stick with those, gain and train with those instructors and really gain a hold on what they are wanting you to learn and use.<\/p>\n<h3>Sifu Justin Och and Master Keith Teller<\/h3>\n<p>Sifu Justin Och and Master Keith Teller, Hanshi got acquainted on International Wing Chun Day when Sifu Justin Och visited his large dojo. With a boxing ring, tons of heavy bags, floor mats, separated areas for training a variety of styles and systems of self defense. The Gainesville Dojo has a old school &#8220;Rocky&#8221; gym feel with a foshan china multi-school mentality.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the principles of combat and fighting both internal and external are welcomed at the Gainesville Dojo.<\/p>\n<p>Visit there website at &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gainesvilledojo.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.gainesvilledojo.net <\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Gainesville Dojo systems of self Defense<\/strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/<\/p>\n<p><strong>Western Boxing<\/strong> &#8211; The Boxing class will give the individual basic techniques, footwork and proper use of equipment used in boxing training.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Kickboxing<\/strong> &#8211; The kickboxing program teaches the correct punching and kicking format for competition or for protection.
