He asked for the key to using&nbsp;Wing Chun vs Jab, Cross, Hook, Takedown Combo. Sifu Justin Och and Senior Instructor Garret Brumfield posted a video titled <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7bfI2MOn_oI\">&#8220;Wing Chun vs Jab, Cross, Hook, Takedown Combo&#8221;<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/7bfI2MOn_oI\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>In this article we will address some of the finer points. Stopping&nbsp;this combo is no easy task but Wing Chun does have an answer.<\/p>\n<h2>Wing Chun vs Jab, Cross, Hook, Takedown Combo<\/h2>\n<h3>The Jab<\/h3>\n<p>If you are to deal with an attack you must understand it. To understand strikes you must make a distinction between committed and non-committed strikes. A committed strike could be defined as a strike that has the entire weight of the body fueling the power for the strike. Alternatively, a non-committed strike will be much faster but won&#8217;t have the power. A jab is a non committed strike. That being the case, the counter must be equally fast. As you can see in the video Sifu Och uses his paak sao but immediately follows up with a straight punch. This allows for quick adjustments where needed.<\/p>\n<h3>The Jab, Cross<\/h3>\n<p>If your opponent crosses immediately after his jab you may not have time to follow up off the initial strike. Sifu chose is one of the most direct options to counter although there are many variations. The hand that was used to paak the initial strike simply follows its trajectory to the face. In conjunction, the back hand paaks the next strike. This results in and immediate strike to your opponents face.<\/p>\n<h3>The Jab, Cross, Hook<\/h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say that your counter does not damage your opponent enough. As a result, he follows up again with a hook. The hook that Sifu Och Demonstrates is a very tight &#8220;rabbit&#8221; hook. Theses types of hooks are very hard to deal with. A Bui Sao, Bui Jee, Man Sao will be very hard to execute in this scenario. You must be able to fully extend these techniques for them to become effective. When the opponent throws this hook, it will be very tight to the body with a lot of torque. Torque equals power, and if you are unable to fully extend your technique it will crumble. In this scenario Sifu chooses to utilize upward elbow to cover the opponents strike. He is now able to strike with is other hand and move on with his attack.<\/p>\n<h3>The Jab, Cross, Hook, Takedown<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright wp-image-8389 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/24104117\/17693117_10211973694912812_345342688_o-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"wing chun vs jab cross hook\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/24104117\/17693117_10211973694912812_345342688_o-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/24104117\/17693117_10211973694912812_345342688_o-400x533.jpg 400w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/24104117\/17693117_10211973694912812_345342688_o-768x1025.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/24104117\/17693117_10211973694912812_345342688_o-450x600.jpg 450w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/24104117\/17693117_10211973694912812_345342688_o.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Finally, we moved on to dealing last part of the&nbsp;combo. None of your counters have successfully stopped your opponent but because you are in so tight he feels the need to shoot in and take you down.&nbsp;There are two scenarios to be address when an opponent shoots in on you. If he gets under your elbow or not.<\/p>\n<p>If he does not get under your able a you can simple remove the foot he is attacking and stop his forward motion with a Gum or Jum Sao to the neck\\head.&nbsp;This is addressed in our article <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/fighting-footwork\/\">Fighting Footwork<\/a>&nbsp;where we go into a little more depth. However, if he does get behind one of your elbows you must sprawl back or you will be taken down. Once you have sprawled you can then establish a line of defense again with your Jum or Gum Sao. This line allows you to regain your structure and move on with your attack.<\/p>\n<h2>End the fight<\/h2>\n<p>At each stage of the attack your goal as a Wing Chun practitioner should be to the end the fight. When you respond to an attack you should be immediately seeking to follow it up to finish your opponent.&nbsp;You would only utilized these counter techniques if you are unable to flow into and 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc. follow up. So in theory, your opponent will never get to his takedown, or his cross for that matter. However, that is why we as martial artists should always be prepared. If the worst happens, you will be ready.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When you respond to an attack you should be immediately seeking to follow it up to finish your opponent.
