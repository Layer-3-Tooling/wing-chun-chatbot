As a boxer he said that must be pretty simple and lots of fun, I&#8217;d jump at the chance to give it a shot. But after mere 3 punches he pulled out with an ache in his knuckles, hands and wrist. After many years that same boxer contacted me and stated that the preparation and footwork he was given had enhanced his ring battling so strikingly that after sessions his opponent was asking what he was doing and what he was preparing in. He said he felt extremely blessed to have prepared in Wing Chun and that his Kung Fu preparing had touched his existence both professionally and directly. This is the motivation behind Wing Chun, of Kung Fu, to enhance your existence entirely.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#\"><strong>Wing<\/strong> <strong>Chun<\/strong> Muscle Conditioning Lakeland FL<\/a><br \/>\nSifu Och Wing Chun Lakeland Florida<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\">https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\">http:\/\/www.facebook.com<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"mailto:sifuochsifuoch@facebook.com\">sifuochsifuoch@facebook.com<\/a><br \/>\n116 east pine street, Lakeland Florida<br \/>\n863.800.0171<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Muscle conditioning with King Fu is a great way to build strength, endurance, and power.
