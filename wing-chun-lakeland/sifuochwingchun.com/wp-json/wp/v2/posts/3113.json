The seminar was a meeting place for practitioners from every lineage, level and walk of life.&nbsp; David Peterson was joined by many faithful instructors from John Smith, Ged Kennerk and Jason Gowan as well as many more. After a fun filled weekend filled with techinques, details and laughter I was invited by David Peterson to join him for his Odense Denmark Seminar, which I made plans, flight and scheduling at the last moment to take advantage of this learning opportunity.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3151\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3151\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/24102208\/david-peterson.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-3151 \" title=\"David Peterson Wong Shun Leung Ving Tsun Kung Fu Academy\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/24102208\/david-peterson.jpg\" alt=\"David Peterson Wong Shun Leung Ving Tsun Kung Fu Academy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/24102208\/david-peterson.jpg 500w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/24102208\/david-peterson-400x267.jpg 400w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/24102208\/david-peterson-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3151\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Morten Ibsen, John Smith, Justin Och, David Peterson,. Wong Shun Leung Ving Tsun Kung Fu Seminar<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Catching a flight from London, England I flew into Copenhagen, Denmark and then took a 2+ hour train into Odense Denmark where I joined the Denmark Wing Chun David Peterson WSL group under Morten Ibsen. Morten Ibsen, John Smith, his wife and students were all extremely welcoming during the Denmark seminar.&nbsp; A great group that led there way, helping, and training practitioners from all over Denmark.&nbsp; I then took a flight with David Peterson, his wife, John Smith and his wife into Manchester England to participate in all of the David Peterson Wong Shun Leung Ving Tsun seminars.&nbsp; Focusing on specific drills, training, footwork and applicable close-fighting techniques.<\/p>\n<p>David Peterson has a refreshing approach and attitude about the advancement of the Wing Chun system.&nbsp; His approach takes the details of each and every section, form and purpose behind each technique, drill and strike.&nbsp; His instructors are open, welcoming and honest wanting those that have real dedication and perseverance to get what they have to offer.<\/p>\n<p>It was a pleasure meet and train with David Peterson, John Smith, Jason Gowan, Ged Kennerk, Morten Ibsen and everyone of the instructors and students that I met.&nbsp; Each of them took their personal time to answer any questions and even train personally with me to give and go over the details.&nbsp; It was also an great honor to hear David Peterson say &#8220;When you get back, tell all of your students Welcome to the Wong Shun Leung family&#8221;.&nbsp;
