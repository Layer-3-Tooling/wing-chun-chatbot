Do they talk about flowing or striking? Do they talk about theories or what they last reacted to and did?&nbsp; Watch the instructors elder students, if you wish to emulate them, how they act and react, how they move and what comes out of them then train there as you will become like them in the years to come.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you want for your future and what are you goals?&nbsp; Seek a school that teaches and constantly seeks to have each of its students attain those goals.&nbsp; <\/strong>Our school wants you to know and learn for realistic self defense.&nbsp; We want you to learn how to actually USE everything within the Wing Chun system.&nbsp; Everything out of the forms, the wooden dummy, chi sau, and fighting combinations should be useful in practical self defense.&nbsp; Knowing is half of the battle, applying is the other half.&nbsp; To learn about different lineages, their differing instruction and perspectives, to expand your skills and knowledge within the combat martial arts and Wing Chun under the Ip Man Wing Chun system contact us at;
