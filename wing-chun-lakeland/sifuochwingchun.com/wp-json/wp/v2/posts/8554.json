Prior to Wing Chun, I had practiced Karate for ten years and had already fallen madly in love with the martial arts. The Karate that I do incorporates a mixture of Tung Su do, Aikido, and Jujitsu and is infinitely different than Wing Chun. But when I moved to Lakeland for school, I knew that I had to find somewhere new to practice. As a broke college student, I also knew that I couldn\u2019t really afford to train, but I really couldn\u2019t afford not to. After doing a trial month at Sifu Och Wing Chun, I decided that I had to make it work.<\/p>\n<h2>First Weeks of Training wing chun difference<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-8561\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/24104319\/difference-in-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-florida.jpg\" alt=\"wing chun difference lakeland florida\" width=\"226\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/24104319\/difference-in-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-florida.jpg 226w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/24104319\/difference-in-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-florida-170x300.jpg 170w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px\" \/>The first two weeks of training I was extremely cautious and suspicious of everything that Sifu taught. It was so different from everything I knew, that at first it felt like it couldn\u2019t possibly be right.<\/p>\n<p>But over those two weeks I grew to trust Sifu and appreciate Wing Chun as a martial art. Now whenever I feel like something isn\u2019t right, it\u2019s usually because I\u2019m doing it wrong. Wing Chun is so different than <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/karate-and-wing-chun-share-origins\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Karate<\/a> that it took a lot of getting used to. I constantly wanted to use my legs and felt trapped in all the hands only combat that they focus on in beginner Wing Chun.<\/p>\n<p>Though I was reluctant to rely heavily on them, hand work was something that I desperately needed to improve. Another major difference that messed with my head was how <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/reader-question-wing-chun-sparring-tips\/\">Wing Chun fights <\/a>squared up instead of sideways. I had to constantly force my back shoulder into a square position effectively distracting me \u2013 but I quickly learned to love having both hands up and in front of me.<\/p>\n<h2>Karate girl Learning to Love Wing Chun<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8560 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/24104317\/infinite-difference-in-wing-chun-lakeland-florida.jpg\" alt=\"infinite wing chun difference lakeland florida\" width=\"226\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/24104317\/infinite-difference-in-wing-chun-lakeland-florida.jpg 226w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/24104317\/infinite-difference-in-wing-chun-lakeland-florida-170x300.jpg 170w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px\" \/>Learning to love Wing Chun was a struggle at first. Because some of the techniques were contrary to my first love of Karate, it felt a little bit like betrayal. I had been training Karate for ten years! For the past five years, I had been teaching and instructing the art that I love. Now suddenly I was at the bottom of the food chain, knowing absolutely nothing about Wing Chun \u2013 it was a hard transition to say the least, but one well worth making. I was soon able to respect and appreciate each art for their differences, and have started down the road of incorporating them both.<\/p>\n<h2>First couple of months in Training<\/h2>\n<p>Learning Wing Chun in and of itself is hard. For the first couple of months I was very confused in my training. &nbsp;Trying to keep up with all the Chinese terminology and different techniques. It took about 2-3 months for my confusion to subside and for me to feel comfortable, performing all the moves that I\u2019d learned.<\/p>\n<h2>Too many give up to quickly<\/h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, a lot of people give up in those first few months feeling like they won\u2019t ever get it. Every single person that I got my first sash with has left as well, and it is so sad! What I have learned from Wing Chun has been exponentially beneficial to almost every aspect of my life. <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-8558\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/24104313\/karate-vs-difference-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-fl.jpg\" alt=\"karate vs wing chun difference kung fu lakeland fl\" width=\"300\" height=\"216\">My overall health and fitness has improved including strength and endurance. My mental health improved as well, relieving the stresses of daily life in class every night. This year I started a very emotionally draining internship dealing with girls that have been sex trafficked. &nbsp;Wing Chun allowed me to refrain from going insane and relieve my frustration.<\/p>\n<p>I would recommend Sifu Och Wing Chun to anyone that wants to be able to protect themselves. &nbsp;If you want to better their health, and make friends \u2013 and who doesn\u2019t want that? &nbsp;You should be down here training.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Written by Sarah L.<\/strong> <em>(recently passed her year and a half mark!)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>For information on classes contact us at<\/strong><br \/>\ncall us now at 863.800.0171<br \/>\n116 east pine street, lakeland florida 33801<br \/>\nWith classes 6 days a week for Adults, teens and kids ages 3 and up.<br \/>\n<strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/classes\/lakeland-wing-chun-kung-fu-classes\/\">https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/classes\/lakeland-wing-chun-kung-fu-classes\/<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>wing chun difference The wing chun difference&nbsp;for me started at Sifu Och Wing Chun about a year and a half ago and couldn\u2019t be happier that I did.
