This may mean causing them to react to something that you throw and then exploiting their reaction. Or using their previous attack to your advantage by controlling it and guiding it into your next attack. Manipulation also involves the use of feints and other misleading maneuvers that end in a desired response.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li>\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>The art of timing<\/b><\/span><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Timing is an essential martial art skill, and most learn it through trial and error. The problem with this approach is that it takes a very long time for the practitioner to be able to execute proper timing and even longer to understand what they are doing. Timing training can and should be supplemented with drills that specifically target the skill. <\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li>\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>Ducking, bobbing, and weaving<\/b><\/span><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Too often do we choose to rely exclusively on the blocks that our art has taught us, while completely ignoring the fact that we don\u2019t actually need to even make contact with the attack. Not only does this eliminate the blow, but we are also able to keep both of our hands up and ready to attack at will.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li>\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>Development of senses<\/b><\/span><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">This quality refers to both improving our natural senses and becoming more aware of our surroundings. Improved senses naturally increase our situational awareness and both lend themselves to increasing our personal safety. Allowing us to be able to effectively use our martial art skill. <\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li>\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>Conditioning<\/b><\/span><\/span><\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7427\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7427\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-7427 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/24103543\/ving-tsun-wing-chun-history-300x216.jpg\" alt=\"Kung Fu Training\" width=\"300\" height=\"216\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-7427\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shaolin Conditioning<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Though highly prized by some schools, many others choose to ignore the benefits of conditioning. The body should be able to withstand a good degree of abuse in order to have the confidence to be an effective fighter. Odds are that you will get hit, what counts is that you are able to come back from that hit and power through \u2013 causing more damage to your opponent. <\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li>\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>Developing intent over instinct<\/b><\/span><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Many fighters prove to be either overly intentional in their movements or overly instinctual. A good martial artist will develop a fighting style that balances these two traits, and develops the muscle memory required to execute it. To a point where they are strategic, yet also reactive with good instincts. <\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li>\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>Proper breath control<\/b><\/span><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Developing appropriate breathing supports each and every martial art technique. Allowing for more focused and powerful strikes. As well as better cardiovascular function and endurance during a match.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li>\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>Familiarity of pressure points<\/b><\/span><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">When all else fails, it is always nice to know how to exploit pressure points. Often times it is the more muscular men that are more susceptible to this exploitation, due to the greater surface area and nerve endings the muscles bring. <\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li>\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>Simultaneous blocking and attacking<\/b><\/span><\/span><\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_8536\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8536\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-8536 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/24104258\/Wing-Chun-Lakeland-Florida-Kung-Fu-Deep-Patel-training-classes-300x216.jpg\" alt=\"my lakeland wing chun journey deep patel florida\" width=\"300\" height=\"216\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-8536\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tan Sao Punch<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Many martial arts will focus on blocking an attack, and then following that block with a strike. Instead of choosing to defend and attack at the same time. They get stuck on their traditional blocks while the opposite hand just idly sits and waits.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li>\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>Development of character and personal strength<\/b><\/span><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Finally, martial arts is not in its\u2019 entirety about fighting. A true martial artist aspires to better themselves in every area of their life, from their character to their physical fitness. They choose to respect themselves and others, and strive to pass on the great knowledge that the martial arts has taught them. <\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">All martial arts were designed during times of strife in order to combat the ugliest parts of humanity. You must keep these in mind during training to ensure the original intentions of these arts are not forgotten. Does your school incorporate all, some, or none of these qualities? <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The world of modern martial arts is full of commercialized schools with watered down training.
