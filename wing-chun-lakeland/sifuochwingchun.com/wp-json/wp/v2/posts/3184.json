This next level Wing Chun training was a bit hard for me at first. I was badly in need of training, discipline, exercise, and friends (not necessarily in that order). Within weeks I had all of these things. Sifu Och was willing to train (and even retrain) me in the art of Wing Chun.&nbsp; Here at Sifu Och Wing Chun I had regular excercise which dramatically dropped my blood pressure and kept me from needing medication. The other students, sihings (senior student instructors), and Sifu Och were friendly and welcoming. I even became a bit more disciplined, though I&#8217;m still working on that. Better still, Sifu Justin Och opened up new avenues of thought for me, concerning the &#8220;next level&#8221; and &#8220;right now&#8221;. Having already studied&nbsp;Wing Chun for five or six years under a different teacher, I thought I knew &#8220;how things were done&#8221;. Sifu Och would show me a different way of standing, moving, or using a given skill that I was used to, and I wanted to argue that it should be &#8220;this other way&#8221; I was taught. (As a side note, never argue with your Sifu. They don&#8217;t deserve disrespect.) Sifu Justin Och was great at showing me the &#8220;why&#8221; of the techniques and slowly I began to understand. There is more than one way to practice Wing Chun. Getting to this&nbsp;next level Wing Chun, while hard, was worth every hour I spent.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>This was a new &#8220;next level wing chun&#8221; in my understanding.&nbsp; Now I eagerly look forward to the times when what I learned before and the Wing Chun I am learning now don&#8217;t match, because it means I get to understand even more. The best part of this process is that Sifu Och has never once said, &#8220;Because I said so&#8221;. He has only ever told me to try it both ways, and see which one is more effective.&nbsp; He has also given me a new benchmark by which to measure a technique&#8217;s effectiveness.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The &#8220;right now&#8221; was not as tough mentally, but it still took some getting used to. At Sifu Och&#8217;s Wing Chun school, we fight.&nbsp; Of course we put on gear (gloves, chest piece, headgear), but we then proceed to go at it. In the five to six years I had trained I had never sparred before, since I held the belief that because we can&#8217;t use &#8220;all&#8221; Wing Chun techniques with sparring it wasn&#8217;t an appropriate practice venue. I do, however, like to fight, so I went ahead and sparred\u2014and almost immediately found out what skill I was, and wasn&#8217;t, good at applying in a fight. This showed me for example, that &#8220;right now&#8221;, I can effectively pak sau a straight punch most of the time, and that my footwork is still in need of more work. I now know there is a world of difference between applying a technique during drills and getting it right with a roundhouse flying at my head.&nbsp; I have also learned just how effective Wing Chun can be against any type of attacker, which only serves to deepen my appreciation for this marital art. Mostly, I am supremely grateful for the opportunity to train in an art that I love, under an awesome instructor with many other encouraging and motivating students. I will always be a student of Wing Chun, but I am honored, thankful, and proud to be a student at Sifu Och&#8217;s Wing Chun Kung fu school in&nbsp;Lakeland, Florida.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you very much for your time. Now, please, excuse me, I have to go train.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Greg Deibert, student<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I am a student of Wing Chun kung fu.
