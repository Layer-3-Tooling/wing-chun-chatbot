I spent 10 years, beginning in college and continuing through my early 30\u2019s, studying, competing and progressing through the facets of TaeKwonDo. Having devoted a significant amount of time to my training, I felt confident I had a strong base of skills that would successfully allow me to protect myself. However, after walking into the Sifu Och <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/marketing\/wing-chun-kung-fu-classes\/\">Wing Chun Kung Fu<\/a> studio, I quickly realized\u2014at the end of just my second day of training\u2014that I had totally deluded myself about my ability to protect myself with in any practical self-defense.<\/p>\n<h2>Practical Self-Defense Starts with the Stance<\/h2>\n<p>Fortunately,&nbsp;Sifu Och didn&#8217;t belittle or condemn my TaeKwonDo or the art itself. Truth be told,&nbsp;I was desperate to see what I could use from my TaeKwonDo background that would be successful in a real self-defense situation. On the first day, I heard a lot about Wing Chun stances and structure and a thing they called \u201crooting.\u201d At that point I didn&#8217;t really understand what \u201crooting\u201d was, but I was fully confident my traditional TaeKwonDo fighting 80\/20 T-Stance&nbsp;would&nbsp;keep me in good balance.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Note on the TaeKwonDo 80\/20 T-Stance<\/strong><br \/>\nAn 80\/20 T-Stance has 80% of the fighter\u2019s weight on the rear leg and 20% on the front leg. The stance allows for fast front leg kicks while being able to lean back on the rear leg and keep your head out of your opponent\u2019s range.<\/p>\n<h2>PRACTICAL SELF-DEFENSE &#8211; Take Two<\/h2>\n<p>I asked Sifu Och why I couldn&#8217;t just use my TaeKwonDo T-Stance. He politely asked, \u201cMay I demonstrate?\u201d (I would later learn to love those words because it means he wants to&nbsp;show me something\u2014not just tell me why something was correct\/incorrect, stronger\/weaker, or better\/worse, etc.) I agreed to let him demonstrate. He asked me to take my T-Stance and cross my hands over my chest. He also had 2 people stand behind me. Sifu pushed me evenly at my shoulders and the next thing I knew, I was totally off balance going backward into the waiting arms of the 2 students behind me. He told me to reset and we tried it a few more times with the same result. I was honestly shocked and a little disappointed that I couldn&#8217;t keep my footing against a simple push. However, I&#8217;d never had to defend against a push in TaeKwonDo because pushing was an &#8220;illegal&#8221; technique.<\/p>\n<p>Pushing happens ALL THE TIME in real-world street combat situations. I had no idea practical self-defense had so much to do with my stance.<\/p>\n<p>Next, Sifu had me put my hands up in a typical fighting stance and keep my TaeKwonDo T-Stance to see if this would improve my balance against the push. My fists collapsed into my body, and I still went backwards. Next, he said to try to come forward and attack him in any way I wanted. Since my main arsenal from TaeKwonDo was kicking, I attempted a round kick from the front foot to the ribs. Before my kick even came out to its full extension, Sifu had gently swept my rear leg, and I was <em>again<\/em> on my back. I reset and threw a side kick from my back leg. This time Sifu stepped forward, caught my kicking leg and just pushed forward with his body, and I was off balance and on the floor.<\/p>\n<p>How could something so simple as a push destroy the TaeKwonDo foundational stance I&#8217;d been taught and used religiously? Even worse, if this was my chosen stance for fighting, what would happen if I was really attacked on the street? How could I use my kicks against an attacker, if my stance made me vulnerable? All my attacker would have to do is shove me and I&#8217;d be knocked on my behind.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, I found this realization disturbing and knew I had to learn a more practical form of self-defense than what TaeKwonDo had offered me. I began my journey into the study of Wing Chun almost two years ago and have seen its effectiveness\u2014not only in its stances but also in many other areas.
