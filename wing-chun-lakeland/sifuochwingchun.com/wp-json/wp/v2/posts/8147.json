That was like a ninja!\u201d&nbsp; I also catch the items knocked off shelves with a lot more ease.&nbsp; The wrist against wrist drill has helped my sensitivity improve into reaction.&nbsp; It has given me more confidence in handling myself.&nbsp; I always knew my normal movements gave me power but now I am learning to channel that power more efficiently through stance and technique.&nbsp; I am more confident that I\u2019m more prepared for situations when I\u2019m out on the town or at work. &nbsp;&nbsp;I believe there are many applications I could have used previously in my life as a football player.&nbsp; Namely the footwork and center line punch drill.&nbsp; Both would have greatly helped me as an offensive lineman and coach.&nbsp; It also adds to my overall scariness.<\/p>\n<h2>WING CHUN&nbsp;IN TAMPA BAY &nbsp;|&nbsp;EFFECTIVE&nbsp;MARTIAL ARTS<\/h2>\n<p>As the days grow closer to my son\u2019s birth, I look forward to sharing Wing Chun with him.&nbsp; I hope he will benefit from Wing Chun training developing skill, balance and confidence.&nbsp; I see Wing Chun as an opportunity to develop father and son bonds.<\/p>\n<p>I would also like to share a&nbsp;little bit of Wing Chun History with you,&nbsp;a southern Chinese martial art mentioned during the period of the Red Boat Opera in the Late 1800s.&nbsp; Developed by southern Shaolin monks to help combat the Manchurians.&nbsp; It is influenced by other Fujian martial arts that preferred short steps and close fighting, with arms placed close to the chest and elbows close to the flanks offering protection.&nbsp; A simple boxing form quickly mastered by dedicated practitioners.&nbsp; Two key figures keeping Wing Chun system alive after the burning of southern temples were Yat Chum Dai Si, 22<sup>nd<\/sup> generation Siu Lam Grandmaster monk, and Cheung Ng, also known as Tan Sao Ng within the opera.&nbsp; It was taught to other rebels taking refuge with the opera.&nbsp; From there it spread along the coast and rivers of south-eastern China by people who lived by and on the water.&nbsp; The Shaolin nun myth was most likely created to protect the identities of the creators and perpetuators of the Wing Chun system.&nbsp; Wing Chun translates to Spring Chant or Spring Praise.<\/p>\n<h2>THE Florida Wing Chun Headquarters<\/h2>\n<p>Sifu Justin Och<br \/>\n11 Countries Traveled<br \/>\nContact us at 863.800.0171<br \/>\nRegional Director for World Ving Tsun Association in charge of entire Southeastern USA<br \/>\n3x certified and tested as an Ip Man lineage Sifu<br \/>\n116 E. pine st, lakeland FL 33801<br \/>\nFan page \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/facebook.com\/sifuochwingchun\">Http:\/\/facebook.com\/sifuochwingchun<\/a><br \/>\nWebsite \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>TAMPA BAY WING CHUN SCHOOL &nbsp;|&nbsp;SELF DEFENSE I have spent the last year training with Tampa Bay Wing Chun School run by Garret and I have noticed improvements in myself.&nbsp;
