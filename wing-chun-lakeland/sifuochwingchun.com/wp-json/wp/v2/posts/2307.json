Wing Chun Forms and fighting combinations are based on three basic principles: Practicality, Efficiency and Economy of Motion.<\/p>\n<h3>Wing Chun&#8217;s Real Practicality<\/h3>\n<p>Blocking and attacking is key in any realistic and practical&nbsp;self defense system. In Wing Chun,&nbsp;techniques like a Tan Sau punch (or &#8220;Palm lifting towards the heavens&#8221;) both stops an incoming strike and hits the practitioner at the same time. Crane Kung Fu movements such as Wing Chun&#8217;s Bong Sau or Wing Arm application deflect strikes along the centerline and expose the outside of the assailant&#8217;s body for follow up attacks. Paak Sau&#8217;s such as the Slap Hand or quick press are used to redirect an assailant&#8217;s incoming strike while allowing&nbsp;the Wing Chun fighter to remain quick and nimble. These are just a few of the techniques used. Wing Chun&nbsp;Forms is designed to maim, tear, strike, and injure some of the most&nbsp;vulnerable parts&nbsp;of the human body. Areas that are sensitive to strikes and cannot be built up such as the eyes, groin, joints,&nbsp;throat, temple, spine, and much more. Though all of the techniques within&nbsp;Wing Chun forms are strictly used in a life threatening situation where you have done what ever possible to not use such extreme self defense for you and your family.<\/p>\n<h3>Wing Chun&nbsp;Forms Efficiency<\/h3>\n<p>With all the martial arts out there, Wing Chun forms are&nbsp;rare because they&nbsp;don&#8217;t simply use force against force. Many other arts talk about this, but few can demonstrate&nbsp;this against a struggling assailant that is striking or kicking. Using Wing Chun forms allows you&nbsp;to manipulate the body&#8217;s torque, momentum, and energy to your benefit.&nbsp;With training, accurately timing, and appropriately positioned techniques, you can master&nbsp;attacks and&nbsp;counter-attacks that&nbsp;manipulate an&nbsp;assailant&#8217;s own force against himself. The more contact you have with the assailant, the quicker your reflexes will develop\u2014and you can gain more control with that&nbsp;contact and&nbsp;increase your awareness of how to best respond and react.<\/p>\n<h3>Wing Chun&nbsp;Forms Economy of Motion<\/h3>\n<p>When we talk about the economy of motion, we mean a&nbsp;linear concept where movements are based on a&nbsp;point&nbsp;&#8220;A&#8221; to&nbsp;point &#8220;B&#8221; without any inbetween movements that waste motion. This economy of motion&nbsp;attacks an imaginary line along the center line such as the spine. This center line&nbsp;(or&nbsp;centerline, central line, or mother line) contains the most abundant amount of vitals&nbsp;along a single point. All offensive and defensive movements are based on the centerline axis and are&nbsp;used to both protect and attack this concept while keeping with the economy of motion.<\/p>\n<h2>Wing Chun Forms<\/h2>\n<h3>Empty Hand Standing Forms<\/h3>\n<p>There are three empty hand standing forms within Wing Chun.&nbsp;The first form is&nbsp;Sil Lum Tao or Siu Nim Tao which is the first young form or foundational form, the second Wing Chun form is Chum Kiu which focuses on movement, balance,&nbsp;hip rotation, torque, and rooting. The third and final Wing Chun form is called Biu Jee which is a Wing Chun form that breaks the principles and is taught with sweeps, emergency applications, escapes, short range hooks, beginner multiple attacker preparation, and extreme short range&nbsp;and long-range techniques and applications.<\/p>\n<h3>Weapon Forms<\/h3>\n<p>The 8&#8242; (eight foot) long pole or Dragon Pole as well as the&nbsp;Bart Chum Dao or&nbsp;Butterfly Swords are two weapon forms and attacking combinations that are taught as extensions of Wing Chun. Though used as advanced training, many practitioners&nbsp;do not make it to this stage of combat weapon training\u2014not for any other reason but lack of determination and persistence.<\/p>\n<h3>Wooden Dummy Form or Muk Yan Jong Form<\/h3>\n<p>This Wing Chun form uses a wooden device that orginally was used in the Shaolin Temple. The arms and leg represent attacking and blocking points on the human body whereas the &#8220;trunk&#8221; or middle section is the centerline of the assailant&#8217;s vitals. This device trains timing, perfection of technique, applications, angling, position, control, striking, and footwork.<\/p>\n<p>Sifu Och&#8217;s Wing Chun Kung Fu studio in Downtown Lakeland Florida&nbsp;is one of the best places to understand all of these concept&#8217;s.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The concept of Wing Chun forms isn&#8217;t difficult to grasp, but it is multifaceted in both nature and structure.
