Not too many people know that the popular Bruce Lee was himself was a student of Ip Man the modern founder and Grandmaster who taught the young Bruce Lee the art of Wing Chun. Bruce Lee has only ever had two formal martial art instructors, both were Wing Chun Kung Fu; Ip Man and Wong Shun Leung (the combat fighter of Ip Man). After so many years, and&nbsp; especially after the 2010 release of the Ip Man Movies from Hong Kong it gave the world a taste of Wing Chun fighting in action.&nbsp; Wing Chun is now being practiced all over the world, this martial arts discipline used to be limited to only a few very dedicated, worthy and lucky students.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/24101207\/6.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1248\" title=\"florida wing chun kung fu school - lakeland, florida \" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/24101207\/6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/24101207\/6.jpg 400w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/24101207\/6-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a>Men and women, no matter their built can learn Wing Chun. You will be surprised to learn that this discipline was created by five shaolin master&#8217;s with the most influence coming&nbsp; from a woman named Ng Mui, a Buddhist nun. She taught the art of Wing Chun to Yim Wing Chun, a female student after whom the martial arts was named after.<\/p>\n<p>If you have seen the once inch punch of Bruce Lee then you have seen a sample of the close range power of Wing Chun. Most students are wary about learning Wing Chun for fear that it is weak as it has been influenced and created by women. But after they discover that this is the discipline behind Bruce Lee\u2019s popular moves, his creation of Jeet Kune Do, and that many martial art styles have tried to take from this quick and direct system of combat they start to think differently. More and more students are starting to seek out realistic street self defense and are being encouraged to seek out and enroll in Wing Chun classes.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/24101205\/7.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1247\" title=\"7\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/24101205\/7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/24101205\/7.jpg 400w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/24101205\/7-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a>This system of self defense involves very effective and direct counter attacks and was developed to protect the weak and small against the large and brute strength of other martial arts.&nbsp; Wing Chun uses essential techniques to keep you safe and protected.&nbsp; Wing Chun focuses on the use of quick combat, stance, structure and balance to increase a fighters power and attacking ability. Be just like a bamboo tree, deeply rooted and yet it easily yields and becomes flexible. When pressure is applied the bamboo tree yields, bends and allows might and for to redirect around it though it is not weak because of this but instead becomes stronger.&nbsp; This is why in China, the Wing Chun system of self defense combat is now mandatory anti-terrorist self defense training for all airline stuartists and crew members.<\/p>\n<p>Come down and see our new remodelled facilty and while you are there feel free to try out a class for only $10 bucks!<\/p>\n<p>116 east pine street, lakeland, florida 33801<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\">https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>863.800.0171<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Downtown Lakeland Martial Arts Sifu Och&#8217;s Wing Chun Kung Fu Studio After so many years serving the Lakeland, Fl community we recently remodeled our studio for our self defense and martial art clients!
