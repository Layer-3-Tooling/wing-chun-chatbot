During childhood it was common for my household to consist only of my mother and myself due to my father\u2019s profession. In the event that anyone attached my family, my father wanted to ensure that I&nbsp;could&nbsp;protect myself and&nbsp;my mother in his absence. My father began his search for someone to train his 10 year old son. He&nbsp;hoped to find a martial artist who&nbsp;showed prowess in the ability to subdue an opponent. He also wanted someone who&nbsp;had&nbsp;the passion to pass this ability on.<\/p>\n<p>Out of all the martial art schools he investigated, none of them were able to demonstrate&nbsp;what he was looking for. Most just acted as advanced versions of day care, with more of a focus on discipline rather than the instruction of realistic self-defense techniques. His search finally ended when he came across Sifu Och\u2019s Wing Chun class. At the time those classes took place&nbsp;in Plant City, Florida.<\/p>\n<p>After my mother rained a barrage of emails and phone calls down on Sifu Och, I finally participated in my first class during August of 2007. It was at this moment that I was introduced to one of the most important men in my life. During my first few days of class, <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/instructors\/sifu-justin-och-chief-wing-chun-instructor\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sifu Justin Och<\/a> had taught me two ways to deal with a wrist grab and three basic blocks to stop three various levels of punches. When I saw my father at the end of the week he asked me \u201cSo what did you learn?\u201d I then demonstrated the techniques previously discussed. From that point forward the choice of school solidified. I officially signed up as a student under Sifu Och Wing Chun.<\/p>\n<h2>Continued Training<\/h2>\n<p>I attended <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/kids-martial-arts-classes\/kids-martial-arts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">kids martial arts classes<\/a> three times a week where Sifu taught the basics of Wing Chun and self-discipline. At this point in time, the size of the class never reached more than five students. Most of those classes could have been considered private lessons. By the time I earned my orange sash, the kids class only consisted of two others and myself. It soon&nbsp;merged with the adult&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/marketing\/wing-chun-kung-fu-classes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wing Chun kung fu&nbsp;classes<\/a>. At 12 years old, I became&nbsp;the youngest of the three students to advance into the adult class. Being able to spar&nbsp;provided multiple examples of how the Sifu Och Wing Chun techniques were effective. It didn&#8217;t&nbsp;matter the size difference of the practitioner to the opponent. This was&nbsp;especially true because I was even smaller than all the women in the class.<\/p>\n<p>The teachings of this martial arts school go way beyond just Wing Chun. Through dedication to the art and my Sifu, I was shown true inner awareness and self-control. Restraint and control had to be practiced for every punch thrown to a fellow student\u2019s throat or kick to their knee cap. Over time, I developed not only better skills, but also discipline and respect for everyone. Their rank in class or status in life didn&#8217;t matter. Witnessing and practicing such devastating techniques also made me realize just&nbsp;how fragile the human body really is. With this realization came a certain level of urgency to refrain from resolving conflicts through physical means. Like Sifu told me long ago, \u201cwords are just water under the bridge.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I am blessed to have found this Wing Chun school when I did. Unlike most, I was spared the trial and error of finding the perfect martial arts instructor. The people that I&#8217;ve had the honor of climbing through the ranks with have unshakable honor and loyalty.&nbsp;I would not trade that Wing Chun family for the world. I am a student of Sifu Och, and I always will be.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The following is a testimonial from Wing Chun student, Neckodemos Davison who started training with Sifu Och Wing Chun when it was located in Plant City.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":7729,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[9],"tags":[1484,1879,1903],"class":[2027],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Testimonial: Neckodemos Davison - Sifu Och Wing Chun<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"The following is a testimonial from Wing Chun student, Neckodemos Davison who started training with Sifu Och Wing Chun when it was located in Plant City.\" \/>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/testimonial-neckodemos-davison\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Testimonial: Neckodemos Davison - Sifu Och Wing Chun\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"The following is a testimonial from Wing Chun student, Neckodemos Davison who started training with Sifu Och Wing Chun when it was located in Plant City.\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/testimonial-neckodemos-davison\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Sifu Och Wing Chun\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:publisher\" content=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sifuochwingchun\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2016-10-07T12:00:22+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:modified_time\" content=\"2020-09-07T02:14:38+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/24103658\/neckodemus-testimonial-3.jpg\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:width\" content=\"800\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:height\" content=\"533\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:type\" content=\"image\/jpeg\" \/>\n<meta name=\"author\" content=\"Sifu Och Wing Chun\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:creator\" content=\"@SifuOchWingChun\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:site\" content=\"@SifuOchWingChun\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Written by\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"Sifu Och Wing Chun\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:label2\" content=\"Est. reading time\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data2\" content=\"3 minutes\" \/>\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/testimonial-neckodemos-davison\/\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/testimonial-neckodemos-davison\/\",\"name\":\"Testimonial: Neckodemos Davison - Sifu Och Wing Chun\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/#website\"},\"datePublished\":\"2016-10-07T12:00:22+00:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2020-09-07T02:14:38+00:00\",\"author\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/#\/schema\/person\/0ab72d1719105270640023b4b24f94c1\"},\"description\":\"The following is a testimonial from Wing Chun student, Neckodemos Davison who started training with Sifu Och Wing Chun when it was located in Plant City.\",\"breadcrumb\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/testimonial-neckodemos-davison\/#breadcrumb\"},\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"ReadAction\",\"target\":[\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/testimonial-neckodemos-davison\/\"]}]},{\"@type\":\"BreadcrumbList\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/testimonial-neckodemos-davison\/#breadcrumb\",\"itemListElement\":[{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":1,\"name\":\"Home\",\"item\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":2,\"name\":\"Articles\",\"item\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/category\/articles\/\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":3,\"name\":\"Testimonial: Neckodemos Davison\"}]},{\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/#website\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/\",\"name\":\"Sifu Och Wing Chun\",\"description\":\"Kung Fu and Martial Arts for Kids &amp;
