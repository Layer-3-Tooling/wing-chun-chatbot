But if you aren\u2019t aware of your surroundings, no degree of training is going to help you. Having situational awareness is a choice; one you have to make early on if you want your training to have any real world practicality. So how do we make this choice? <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Understanding the problem<\/span><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The two major obstacles preventing people from having good situational awareness are naivety and laziness. In general, people want to believe in the good of others and often believe that rape or theft is something that happens to other people, but not me. Having this mindset lulls people into a false sense of security which will often last until something does happen, or the person makes a personal decision to make sure that it never does. The laziness factor is hugely prevalent and goes hand in hand with naivety. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8232\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/24104053\/worst-case-self-defesne-lakealnd-florida-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu.jpg\" alt=\"worst case scenario self defense lakeland florida sifu och wing chun kung fu\" width=\"300\" height=\"216\"><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">If I believe that nothing bad will happen, then why should I take steps to ensure that it won\u2019t? It is difficult and emotionally draining to be constantly aware of your surroundings, but entirely necessary if you want to be an effective martial artist. The key is to get to the point where practicing situational awareness is habit, eliminating the need to go that extra mile.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Practical Ways to Increase Situational Awareness<\/span><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Now that we understand the problem, it\u2019s time to fight it:<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>NEVER text and walk.<\/b><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> This is especially important when transitioning between locations, such as your place of work and your car. Wait until you are in a <\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><u>locked<\/u><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> car to address anything on your phone. There have been numerous incidents of muggers targeting people on their phones, simply because they aren\u2019t paying attention. Phone calls are also not advised, however, if you must \u2013 make sure to keep your eyes up, still monitoring your surroundings. <\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>Have your keys ready before you get to the car.<\/b><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> You don\u2019t want to be rummaging around in your bag at your car, looking for keys \u2013 especially at night. The car is a common place of attack and requires extra caution. Do the same from the car to the front door.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>Always check the area around your car before you get in.<\/b><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> Is anyone close enough to get in your car between the time that you unlock it and the time that you are inside? Also make sure that no one has put anything on your car that may impair your driving, necessitating a stop down the road.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>Check the back seat.<\/b><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> Take a look through the windows in the back and make sure that there is no one already in your car waiting for you. Behind the wheel of the car is not the time you want to find out that there is someone in the back dictating your next stop.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>When entering a building, look for exits.<\/b><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> Locate the nearest exit and the quickest route. Whenever possible, position yourself facing the majority of the room and the exit, never with your back to it. <\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Developing situational awareness is a skill that takes both time and dedication. These suggestions are a good starting point to increasing your situational awareness, and the list will only grow once you start practicing them. Some Practices may seem over the top and near paranoia, but personal safety is not something to be taken lightly. When it comes to personal safety and the safety of those around us, we cannot expect someone else to protect us. Take matters into your own hands, be prepared, and decide to be that one person that is actually paying attention. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The two major obstacles preventing people from having good situational awareness are naivety and laziness.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":11,"featured_media":8202,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[3],"tags":[18,20,22,33,66,78,106,255,1143,1576,1598],"class":[2028],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Strategies for Situational Awareness - Sifu Och Wing Chun<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Strategies for Situational Awareness will go over some key points to make sure you are never caught of guard!
