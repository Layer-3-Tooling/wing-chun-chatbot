When we talk about traditional martial arts, we&#8217;re referring to training that&#8217;s rooted in the tenets set forth by the original master of the style or technique. For some,&nbsp;there may have been a change within their school and training as the martial arts have begun&nbsp;steering away from the &#8220;fancy&#8221; and entertaining styles of the past and more towards the efficient realities of modern combat.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Some martial art schools are playing catch-up, just now seeking to show that they are part of a realistic street protection and combat training system. &nbsp;In contrast to this, some&nbsp;schools, like Sifu Och Wing Chun have always sought to train you and your family in empty hand combat, knife defense, gun protection, stick, ground, and defense techniques against multiple attackers. You can likely see the difference between tradtional martial arts training and a modern combat system simply by coming down and trying us out for a week or two.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>Traditional Martial Arts Meets Modern Combat<\/h2>\n<p>The question&nbsp;we ask in developing and honing techniques is&nbsp;&#8220;What is real and usable within a particular style&#8221;. We appreciate and utilize&nbsp;older, traditional&nbsp;training techniques, but with two very distinctive goals: First, we keep those effective techniques and practices&nbsp;alive, and second,&nbsp;we bring back and incorporate the effectiveness&nbsp;for which they were originally&nbsp;developed. In the past 60 years of martial arts training we have seen a change in people&#8217;s attitudes, goals, and especially their mindset (mostly in the West) with respect to&nbsp;the realities and the myths of combative martial arts styles.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1443\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1443\" style=\"width: 320px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/24101352\/lakeland-self-defense-florida-knife-defense-wing-chun-krav-maga-knife.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1443\" title=\"lakeland-self-defense-florida-knife-defense-wing-chun-krav-maga-knife\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/24101352\/lakeland-self-defense-florida-knife-defense-wing-chun-krav-maga-knife.jpg\" alt=\"lakeland-self-defense-florida-knife-defense-wing-chun-krav-maga-knife\" width=\"320\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/24101352\/lakeland-self-defense-florida-knife-defense-wing-chun-krav-maga-knife.jpg 320w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/24101352\/lakeland-self-defense-florida-knife-defense-wing-chun-krav-maga-knife-300x188.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1443\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Wing Chun Florida, knife defense classes<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The want and need for reality based fighting is quickly becoming the face of martial arts within many communities.&nbsp; Though this is nothing new to \u201cOriginal Martial Artists\u201d,&nbsp;a martial artist that seeks the original purpose and effective applications and techniques behind their arts original development.

It has brought back the days of the challenge match, where one school could challenge the performance techniques of another. Wing chun kunf fu is a&nbsp;Traditional Martial Arts Academy. Challenge matches in Fushan and all over China became the proving ground for what worked in your style.&nbsp; It is my hope that this influx brings martial art instructors motivation to push their students and their schools instruction to new heights.<\/p>\n<p>Though not every individual is inspired to join a mixed martial arts, more and more people are being inspired to seek out a style of traditional martial arts or rather original martial arts that will assist them in a life threatening situation.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Wing Chun was a conglomeration of some of the best veteran southern kung fu styles and Shaolin Master&#8217;s within the Sil Lum Temple and China&#8217;s 5,000 years of war.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>They came together as Master&#8217;s of individual specialties and created something together, something they felt would be better.&nbsp; The style itself is a mix of southern Chinese Shaolin martial arts but was created by high ranking Master&#8217;s, each at the pinnacle of their fighting style.
