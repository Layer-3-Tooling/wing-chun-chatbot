These types of humans are nothing more than a loaded gun looking to harm any and all who don&#8217;t give them what they desire when they desire it.&nbsp; The Mindset of a Wing Chun Fighter calls for rapid simultaneous offensive and defensive strikes because one gun shot or one stab could end your life.&nbsp; Minimize as much damage to you and those you love as possible.&nbsp; No Martial Art is perfect or can claim perfection.&nbsp; As martial artists we seek to minimize the damage these types of individuals cause.&nbsp; Thus we seek perfection, peace and long life within the mind, body and spirit, doing our best to support and protect our families and communities.<\/p>\n<p>Wing Chun&nbsp;Kung Fu (Sifu Och, lakeland fl kung fu)&nbsp;seeks all of the appropriated logical and most effective possibilities of counter-attacks and counter measures by an opponent.&nbsp; Wing Chun always attempts to place the opponent&#8217;s body in structurally weak position&#8217;s that are increasingly more advantageous to the Wing Chun practitioner.The Mindset of a Wing Chun Fighter Calculated decisions are made, reactions and intentions are decisive.&nbsp; &nbsp; This is the goal, but getting there takes practice, honing ones skill and utilizing these techniques, concepts and drill them into application.&nbsp; Mastering Wing Chun Kung Fu means complete combat application of gate theory, angling, stepping inward, around and backward while attacking and countering.&nbsp; It means mastering many different approaches and solutions to a single problem, so you keep your opponents guessing while taking advantage of centerline structure, speed and power.&nbsp;&nbsp; It means sparring and applying your knowledge against a multitude of styles and scenarios.&nbsp; Reaction, power and speed of both hands and feet depend on the attack, attacker and the situation at hand.&nbsp; A series of jabs and crosses will allow some practitioners to move in quickly taking advantage of the forward knee that the opponent presents with each jab and cross.&nbsp; Taking out this knee, hip or ribs when exposed will have the opponent&#8217;s body and mind off balance as you continue pressing inward with forward strikes.&nbsp; This same attack may be seen from another practitioner&#8217;s perspective as an opportunity to stay farther away.&nbsp; Biding time while the Wing Chun Kung Fu&nbsp;practitioner analyzes the opponent&#8217;s tactics allowing the practitioner to strike and injury.&nbsp; The opponent&#8217;s arms, legs and other weapons as they present themselves within the fight.&nbsp; This may be done to weaken a stronger opponent, while frustrating them into making mistakes or moving in a direction that has been set up by the Wing Chun Kung Fu practitioner.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2087\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2087\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/24101713\/13.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-2087\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/24101713\/13-300x110.jpg\" alt=\"sifu och downtown lakeland florida kung fu self defense \" width=\"300\" height=\"110\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/24101713\/13-300x110.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/24101713\/13-400x147.jpg 400w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/24101713\/13-600x220.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/24101713\/13.jpg 615w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2087\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">blood is NOT REQUIRED to become a Wing Chun Fighter, just determination, and Sifu Och in downtown lakeland florida has the kung fu self defense for next level application&#8230;

I make sure of it.&nbsp; Your protection is a lifetime of achievement.The Mindset of a Wing Chun Fighter Calculated decisions are made, reactions and intentions are decisive.&nbsp; &nbsp; It is invaluable to you, your loved ones, and every single person you may touch in a positive way throughout your life.&nbsp; PROTECT THAT, because the person attacking you doesn&#8217;t care about your future, doesn&#8217;t care about your loved ones, or about what you have done for your community or your children.&nbsp; The person attacking you only cares about themselves.&nbsp; They have no conscience. If they did, they never would&#8217;ve attacked you and all those who care for you in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>Everything is wishful thinking Every theory, every drill and every application spoken about or shown is only wishful thinking until you make it your own.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t live in just the understanding of concept but the conceptualization of proof and reaction.The Mindset of a Wing Chun Fighter Calculated decisions are made, reactions and intentions are decisive.&nbsp; &nbsp; We cannot live on the stories of our Master&#8217;s or our Great Grandmaster&#8217;s but rather prove their training and applications&nbsp;through our own existence and application.&nbsp; So we can prove and honor the existence they lived for to teach us.&nbsp; The existence they strived for and gave to&nbsp;us.&nbsp; It is truly a power for the protection of others, when we seek to uplift those that uplift others.&nbsp; Through friendship, love and honor, I look forward to each practitioner I meet that wishes to welcome each other as family under our love for real self defense.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure reading this article&nbsp;has left you questions about my&nbsp;way of Wing Chun Kung Fu in Lakeland Florida.&nbsp; I have begun writing these&nbsp;thoughts and perspectives from my travels, practitioners, Masters and Grandmaster&#8217;s I have met that have touched and changed my thoughts on Wing Chun Kung Fu and how Ip Man evolved within this amazing system known as Wing Chun.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Lakeland Fl Kung Fu, our Wing Chun is a system of concept, purpose and drive, in a sense a pure love for Wing Chun Kung Fu.The Mindset of a Wing Chun Fighter Calculated decisions are made, reactions and intentions are decisive.<\/p>\n<p>This website is only a brief anthology of my experience and thoughts.
