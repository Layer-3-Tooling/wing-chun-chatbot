Especially if this student is wanting to learn slow paced techniques for stress management, fancy or flashy that have the&nbsp; impression of martial arts.&nbsp; These types of schools seek to boost confidence without the reality, pounding and harsh training related to the true intentions of their original martial art.&nbsp; I have no problem with martial art facilities that teach these techniques as everyone is not looking for reality or combat training.&nbsp; Though I do take up an accord against ones that tell prospective students they teach self defense when in truth they hardly scratch the surface.&nbsp; In order to get that student to join they tell them whatever they want to hear and show a few &#8220;effective movements&#8221;&nbsp; though once the student joins they are taken for a ride.&nbsp; This gives people the false confidence and the impression that they know and can use real life saving techniques where in reality these techniques could get them killed.&nbsp; Thus honesty and respect are big concerns when it comes to practical application.<\/p>\n<p>Original and traditional instructors that show their arts original combative intent have not taken the road most traveled but rather have decided to make and teach you without compromise.&nbsp; The main stream of commercialized techniques and skills taught in schools can string a student through hoops instead of practical application.<\/p>\n<p>After talking with many instructors of various schools the conclusion most have come to is that they truly believe that the student couldn&#8217;t handle real training.&nbsp; Many have even said that speaking about the harshness of a street fight, knife attack or rape situation would lose them more money than make them.&nbsp; Thus they should be fed fancy moves, false confidence and almost no practical street purpose and weapons that fly in the air only to be caught and spun on wrists and fingers.<\/p>\n<p>I wish to disagree with many of these practices and schools but unfortunately I have seen these schools fill there classes with hundreds of students.&nbsp; None of these students ever asking or questioning the logic in this type of training.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most people want easy answers and to be told they are hardcore.&nbsp; No matter what your style, once you start to train students in the original arts intent, it is extremely hard to keep all those interested.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1690\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1690\" style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/24101513\/best-martial-arts-for-self-defense-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1690\" title=\"best-martial-arts-for-self-defense-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/24101513\/best-martial-arts-for-self-defense-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu1.jpg\" alt=\"best martial arts for self defense sifu och wing chun kung fu\" width=\"250\" height=\"515\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/24101513\/best-martial-arts-for-self-defense-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu1.jpg 250w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/24101513\/best-martial-arts-for-self-defense-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu1-146x300.jpg 146w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1690\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">What is the best martial arts self defense?<br \/>My choice is Wing Chun, what will yours be&#8230;<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>If you do a jump kick and you teach the purpose on how to knock someone out with it showing the 100% full Original war\/street purpose, I applaud you.&nbsp; If you throw weapons, but you do it because your throwing them through an opponent I applaud you.&nbsp; I applaud any and all men and women who teach or seek out such a teacher, that want to instruct them in the Original ways to survive using a traditional martial art.&nbsp; I also applaud and respect those who are truthful about their teachings and tell a prospective student that by no means will the fancy move they are learning or that throwing or twirling a weapon in the air or around your fingers works on the street, but instead telling them hey its fun isn&#8217;t it?<\/p>\n<p>To all of you out there who train hard through respect, honor and dedication I bow to you and ask for more. God knows we need it.&nbsp; We need more support for all truth bringers within the martial arts from both sides of the fence.<\/p>\n<p>It takes a real hardcore person with a passion to want it, search for the purpose behind it and to learn ALL of it, asking what every moves purpose was for survival.&nbsp; Original martial arts are not easy and not fast food, they are \u201cKung Fu\u201d.&nbsp; Take the Original Karate from Okinawa Japan, Muay Thai from Thailand, Taekwondo from Korea, Brazilian JiuJitsu from Brazil and in its Original Art form its all \u201cKung Fu\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>No not because I&#8217;m claiming they all came from Kung Fu!&nbsp; No its because&nbsp; Kung Fu means Time, Dedication and Hardwork and are you not then doing Kung Fu when you practice and teach your style?&nbsp; I bet you didn&#8217;t realize we were Kung Fu brother&#8217;s did you?&nbsp; Well we are so accept it!<\/p>\n<p>So thus if we are brothers in the art of survival, should we not support one another?&nbsp; We are not rivals we are family, and we train towards the safety and protection of the ones we love.&nbsp; The majority of individuals don&#8217;t want to push there body for years under rigorous training that bruises the body, toughens the mind and makes one see through the fancy maneuvers of commercialized Hollywood film drama.&nbsp; Many want to be Bruce Lee without the hard work of Bruce Lee.&nbsp; A body and mind filled with purpose doesn&#8217;t need to put down another art.&nbsp; Instead of fake or misleading information or techniques.&nbsp; Allow the minds of others to become purposeful otherwise they are like sheep and unfortunately they will not see past the hair in their eyes. Stay alert, relaxed and poised on the results at hand, you will succeed you are purpose driven.<\/p>\n<p>For our school with traditions of honor, respect, Chinese cultural heritage are all encompassed within the art of Wing Chun.&nbsp; Wing Chun is my style of choice just like yours may be another, but we are family in one mindset, self preservation and the preservation of others.&nbsp; More than just kicking and punching Wing Chun for me and those I teach is an art where students can find and grow in the original intentions of their previous masters.&nbsp; An enlightenment through reality based survival and increasing endurance and history.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Want to join? contact us Today;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/contact-sifu-och\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/contact-sifu-och\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>The best martial arts self defense, <\/strong><strong>Wing Chun is my style of Choice.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>More info for the best martial arts self defense watch this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kE6h2u9ke38\">videos<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Best Martial Arts Self Defense No original martial art, no matter what its origins had fancy and ill effective moves as it was created for survival and for the quickest and deadliest move for battle in that culture, terrain and current enemy.&nbsp;
