Obviously our children in our programs are not our enemies. However, overcoming their distress is. To use the technique I will explain you must know and understand your children. In my previous articles&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/kung-fu-kids-keeping-your-kids-engaged\/\">Kung Fu Kids: Keeping your Kids Engaged<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/lakeland-afterschool-and-summer-camp-fun\/\">Lakeland Afterschool and Summer Camp Fun<\/a>&nbsp;I briefly mention a few ways to engage your children but also how to connect with them. Listening to them and not just treating them like a &#8220;little kid that is misbehaving&#8221; is a big key. When I speak to them if there was a fight or bad behavior I help them rise to the occasion. I tell them they need to speak to me like an adult. I help them calm their emotions. If they are excited or crying I explain to them I can&#8217;t understand what they are saying. Doing this usually helps them focus in on me and speak clearly.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-8732 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/24104418\/IMG_4412-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/24104418\/IMG_4412-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/24104418\/IMG_4412-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/24104418\/IMG_4412-400x267.jpg 400w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/24104418\/IMG_4412-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/24104418\/IMG_4412.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>By doing so I have seen an increase in respect when it is my turn to say something. By listening to them and explaining to them they must speak to me clearly they know that I am listening. This gains their trust as I watch and learn how they think and communicate. Once problem at a time I gain a little more insight into the differences that each child has. Once I know how their brain works, what they like, dislike, etc., I can now employ one of my favorite techniques when they are overreacting to an injury&#8230;distraction and redirection.<\/p>\n<h3>The Art of Distraction and Redirection<\/h3>\n<p>When a child is hurt their emotional flux tends to be more dramatic then the pain actually calls for. This is typically rooted in the base need for attention to have someone help with the problem. As they grow however, they need to learn that crying is not the best way to get help. But by clearing communicating with an adult. This is not automatically learned however, it must be taught. There is a hurdle when it comes to teaching this though. That hurdle is that emotional wave mentioned earlier. When their emotions are high, it is near impossible to teach them anything let alone communicate. Distraction is the key to breaking that emotional wall you will encounter.<\/p>\n<h4>Distraction<\/h4>\n<p>One of the best ways I have found to &#8220;distract&#8221; the child is connect with them by referring to one of your own injuries. Shifting the focus off of something requires something new to focus on. By relating to them with your own injury they will tend to perk up to hear the story. They want to know what happened to Mr. Tim and his finger and how he got that scar. Once the wave has been calmed by interesting anecdote, their attention must be moved forward or they will relapse into the &#8220;pain&#8221; which was mostly in their mind.<\/p>\n<h4>Redirection<\/h4>\n<p>Redirection is the next key. By moving their focus on something positive, something they enjoy (preferably within the activity being done) their carefree mind will happily get distracted by the next thing. In the story I gave Lyla the option to pick the next warm up. Turns her brain completely away from her finger to &#8220;ooo, I get to pick the next one, which one do I like&#8221;. Once this is done they usually go about the day without remembering their finger at all.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-8730 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/24104416\/IMG_4439-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/24104416\/IMG_4439-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/24104416\/IMG_4439-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/24104416\/IMG_4439-400x267.jpg 400w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/24104416\/IMG_4439-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/24104416\/IMG_4439.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Know your children.
