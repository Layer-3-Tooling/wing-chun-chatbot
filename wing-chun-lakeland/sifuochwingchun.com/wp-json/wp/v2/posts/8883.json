Wing Chun a southern Chinese martial art mentioned during the period of the Red Boat Opera in the Late 1800s. Developed by southern Shaolin monks to help combat the Manchurians. It is influenced by other Fujian martial arts that preferred short steps and close fighting, with arms placed close to the chest and elbows close to the flanks offering protection. A simple boxing form quickly mastered by dedicated practitioners.<\/p>\n<p>Two key figures keeping Wing Chun system alive after the burning of southern temples were Yat Chum Dai Si, 22<sup>nd<\/sup> generation Siu Lam Grandmaster monk, and Cheung Ng, also known as Tan Sao Ng within the opera. It was taught to other rebels taking refuge with the opera. From there it spread along the coast and rivers of south-eastern China by people who lived by and on the water. The Shaolin nun myth was most likely created to protect the identities of the creators and perpetrators of the Wing Chun system. Wing Chun translates to Spring Chant or Spring Praise.<\/p>\n<h2>Tony Plasse: Becoming an Orange<\/h2>\n<p>I remember my first introduction to Wing Chun Kung Fu was an Ip Man movie three years ago. Did not know much about it, but the movie inspired me to research it. I liked the theory behind and thought it would be more practical for myself. High flying kicks, although cool looking, are not my style. When I finally had the opportunity to attend a class near my house I thought to myself, &#8220;this is great&#8221;.<\/p>\n<h3>My Reaction<\/h3>\n<p><a name=\"_GoBack\"><\/a>I <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright wp-image-7290 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/24103358\/tony-plass.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"297\" height=\"236\">have spent the last year training with Sihing Garret and I have noticed improvements in myself. Garret emphasizes physical training at the beginning of each class. I have improved muscle tone and stamina. Wing Chun techniques taught to me have improved my reflexes much to my surprise. Not just in wrist against wrist but in everyday applications. I react to things such as doors flying at my face. I caught one once with a Jum Sau action. The lady next to me said \u201cWow! That was like a ninja!\u201d. I also catch the items knocked off shelves with a lot more ease.<\/p>\n<h3>My Confidence<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright wp-image-8148 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/24104036\/Tony-Plasse-Wing-Chun-Kung-Fu-Tampa-Bay-Florida-153x300.jpg\" alt=\"Tony-Plasse-Wing Chun Kung Fu Tampa Bay Florida\" width=\"153\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/24104036\/Tony-Plasse-Wing-Chun-Kung-Fu-Tampa-Bay-Florida-153x300.jpg 153w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/24104036\/Tony-Plasse-Wing-Chun-Kung-Fu-Tampa-Bay-Florida.jpg 221w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 153px) 100vw, 153px\" \/>The wrist against wrist drill has helped my sensitivity improve into reaction. It has given me more confidence in handling myself. I always knew my normal movements gave me power. But now I am learning to channel that power more efficiently through stance and technique. I am more confident that I\u2019m more prepared for situations when I\u2019m out on the town or at work. I believe there are many applications I could have used previously in my life as a football player. Namely the footwork and center line punch drill. Both would have greatly helped me as an offensive lineman and coach. It also adds to my overall scariness.<\/p>\n<h3>My Future<\/h3>\n<p>As the days grow closer to my son\u2019s birth, I look forward to sharing Wing Chun with him. I hope he will benefit from Wing Chun training developing skill, balance and confidence. I see Wing Chun as an opportunity to develop father and son bonds.<\/p>\n<p>The instruction and encouragement I receive is outstanding. Sihing Garret and Sifu Och inspire me to dedicate myself and continue training. I hope to be an inspiring instructor one day. I look forward to progressing and to be a good representative of Tampa Bay Wing Chun Kung Fu and Sifu Och Wing Chun.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tony Plasse: Becoming an Orange is my story on how I became and Orange Sash level student at the Tampa Wing Chun Academy and what that meant to me.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":8151,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[3,8,1875],"tags":[249,1603,1706,2003],"class":[2027],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Tony Plasse: Becoming an Orange - Sifu Och Wing Chun<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Tony Plasse: Becoming an Orange is my story on how I became and Orange Sash level student at the Tampa Wing Chun Academy and what that meant to me.\" \/>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/tony-plasse-becoming-an-orange\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Tony Plasse: Becoming an Orange - Sifu Och Wing Chun\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Tony Plasse: Becoming an Orange is my story on how I became and Orange Sash level student at the Tampa Wing Chun Academy and what that meant to me.\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/tony-plasse-becoming-an-orange\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Sifu Och Wing Chun\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:publisher\" content=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sifuochwingchun\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:author\" content=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tkittelstad\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2017-10-17T19:00:51+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:modified_time\" content=\"2020-09-07T01:51:07+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/24104038\/Tony-Plasse-Wing-Chun-Kung-Fu-Tampa-Bay-Florida-Fl.jpg\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:width\" content=\"550\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:height\" content=\"250\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:type\" content=\"image\/jpeg\" \/>\n<meta name=\"author\" content=\"Tim Kittelstad\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:creator\" content=\"@SifuOchWingChun\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:site\" content=\"@SifuOchWingChun\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Written by\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"Tim Kittelstad\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:label2\" content=\"Est. reading time\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data2\" content=\"3 minutes\" \/>\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/tony-plasse-becoming-an-orange\/\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/tony-plasse-becoming-an-orange\/\",\"name\":\"Tony Plasse: Becoming an Orange - Sifu Och Wing Chun\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/#website\"},\"datePublished\":\"2017-10-17T19:00:51+00:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2020-09-07T01:51:07+00:00\",\"author\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/#\/schema\/person\/a1f0c8cb447885ed8c465650fa465a9e\"},\"description\":\"Tony Plasse: Becoming an Orange is my story on how I became and Orange Sash level student at the Tampa Wing Chun Academy and what that meant to me.\",\"breadcrumb\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/tony-plasse-becoming-an-orange\/#breadcrumb\"},\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"ReadAction\",\"target\":[\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/tony-plasse-becoming-an-orange\/\"]}]},{\"@type\":\"BreadcrumbList\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/tony-plasse-becoming-an-orange\/#breadcrumb\",\"itemListElement\":[{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":1,\"name\":\"Home\",\"item\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":2,\"name\":\"News\",\"item\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/category\/wing-chun-news\/\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":3,\"name\":\"Tony Plasse: Becoming an Orange\"}]},{\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/#website\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/\",\"name\":\"Sifu Och Wing Chun\",\"description\":\"Kung Fu and Martial Arts for Kids &amp;
