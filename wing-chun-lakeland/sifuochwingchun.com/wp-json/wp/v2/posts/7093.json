Remember that <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/classes\/advanced-wing-chun-classes\/\">advanced Wing Chun classes<\/a> in weapons are an extension of your empty hand training.

He was one of the Shaolin monks that had made an escape during the <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/the-sil-lum-temple-destruction\/\">destruction and burning of the Shaolin Temple<\/a> by the Manchu Government. Abbot Chi Shin was hiding on the red junk boat opera troupe as a cook but in all truth was from the Shaolin monastery. Another Story tells us of a Hung Gar (Hung Kuen) master who worked with the boatmen of the red junk boat. He taught them a fast way of developing great internal power and huge strength that could be assimilated into their Wing Chun training. The simple and fast fighting movements of the dragon pole (luk dim boon gwan) were perfect counterparts to the Wing Chun system. This also shows us that Wing Chun was willing to learn, adapt and give respect to all arts. We are not a system that shun\u2019s other arts but welcomes there fast, simple and effective means at which to end a fight. Wing Chun\u2019s focus in training is in reactions of the fighting mind set, reactions are not fancy they are direct, reactions are not big or flowery they are direct and always centerline. The fighting mind of the dragon pole fighter (luk dim boon gwan) must always be on the most direct and effeicent way of using the pole. The fight must start and end quickly and the drills must build as much internal power as they do external power. You become a fighter that has one goal and one purpose.<\/p>\n<p>The six-and-a-half long pole techniques or points of Wing Chun Dragon Pole fighting are:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Tai kwan (Lifting or Raising Pole)<\/li>\n<li>Biu kwan (Forward Thrusting Pole)<\/li>\n<li>Sot kwan (up\/down crescent circling pole or in\/out Lower Gate Pole)<\/li>\n<li>Lon kwan (High horizontal striking\/deflecting pole or Long Bridge Pole)<\/li>\n<li>Kik kuan (Vertical up\/down striking\/deflecting pole or in\/out Upper Gate Pole)<\/li>\n<li>Huen kwan (Circling\/Deflection pole technique)<\/li>\n<li>(6-1\/2) Ding or Lo kwan (Short Thrust Pole)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The dragon pole (luk dim boon gwan) was used historically as a boat pole, used to guide and push the boat away from rocks as well as to move it along. Much like poles are used on Gondolas in Italy. These poles have different histories as how they got there beginnings in Wing Chun.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7095\" src=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/24103144\/Long-Pole-Weapon-Fighting-or-Dragon-Pole.jpg\" alt=\"Long Pole Weapon Fighting or Dragon Pole\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/24103144\/Long-Pole-Weapon-Fighting-or-Dragon-Pole.jpg 800w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/24103144\/Long-Pole-Weapon-Fighting-or-Dragon-Pole-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/24103144\/Long-Pole-Weapon-Fighting-or-Dragon-Pole-400x267.jpg 400w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/24103144\/Long-Pole-Weapon-Fighting-or-Dragon-Pole-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/24103144\/Long-Pole-Weapon-Fighting-or-Dragon-Pole-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>After the Manchu Government gained full control of China the outlawed all all forms of weaponry so to restrict and keep hold of the Chinese. The Manchu government restricted the work of the Hon\u2019s (Chinese), increased their taxes, burden there economy and forbid them from reaching the higher levels of government office. The Manchu government also forbid and banned the Hon\u2019s (Chinese) from any type of Kung Fu training. Since the Manchu Government had the same religious beliefs of the Shaolin Temple they allowed there training to continue, this proved detrimental as the Shaolin monks created a new system of Kung Fu called Wing Chun that didn\u2019t take the 15-20 years most other styles of kung fu take to master and use.<\/p>\n<p>The Art of Wing Chun survived the Manchu destruction of the Shaolin Temples and went underground in concealment, <a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\/chinese-assassins-espionage\/\">assassination and espionage<\/a>. These Wing Chun master were not always monks and did not have the same religious or moral restrictions as their previous instructors. These Wing Chun rebel\u2019s would hide upon boats as actors going port to port from southern to northern china, using back alleys to take out Manchu generals and high ranking politicians. Wing Chun\u2019s concealed weapons, fast hands and quick reactions were ideal for these close quarter fights. Sharp side or not, imagine getting hit in the neck, joints, ribs, face, wrists, arteries, veins or tendon\u2019s with the speed and precision of Wing Chun with the steel and brass of Wing Chun Butterfly Swords. Trust me, getting hit the blunt side of these Wing Chun swords is enough, the power and speed in this traditional weapon are absolutely incredible and should be respected.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wing Chun\u2019s long pole luk dim boon Gwan, known as the dragon pole, employs a devastating centerline fighting principle with the distance of eight to thirteen feet.
