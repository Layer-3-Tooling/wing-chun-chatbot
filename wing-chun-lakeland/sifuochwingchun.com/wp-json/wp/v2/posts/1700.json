The point of balance between the two objects is the center of mass and is the center of structural stability within this created dynamic.&nbsp; As the strength of one practitioner pushes through the lines of strength of the other these opposing and supporting forces create a balance point.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wing Chun works off of triangles throughout the entire structure.&nbsp; This creates stability due to at least one of the connective parts of a triangle always pointing in the opposite direction of any force being applied.&nbsp; Though if this triangle or position is broken by the practitioner by leaning, over-committing, over-placement of balance or power, then the triangle will dissolve into another shape and no longer have the structural integrity it once did.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on your lineage line, like ours you may have attacks and drills that are placed into this level of ability with continuous flowing chains of offensive and defensive attacks and counters.&nbsp; I have never seen another martial system that has this type of stand up reactive drills and even a third form that trains techniques for surviving and escaping a multiple attacker situation.&nbsp;&nbsp; This type of inherent training is exclusive to Wing Chun.&nbsp; No other art has this type of reaction drills.<\/p>\n<p>Similar energy flow and sensitivity to balance and structure within Tai Chi push hands are seen within Chi Sau but include aggressive attack reactions.&nbsp; Wrist versus Wrist doesn&#8217;t follow predetermined movements but is rather a constant barrage of attacks and reactions at extreme close-quarter.&nbsp; Wing Chun has kept this wrist against wrist tactic to keep both practitioners within striking range as it is easy for a student to start to run away or create huge distance between them and the assailant.&nbsp; Though this is unrealistic for a car assault, home invasion, bar or restaurant attack as the space, chairs, tables and individuals surrounding you don&#8217;t allow for large movements.&nbsp; You must deal with what comes and survive or fail based on your training.<\/p>\n<p>Take a car assault for example.&nbsp; You are parked next to another vehicle and you place your child in their seat.&nbsp; By opening the door you have cut off your only means of escape and the assailant is upon you.&nbsp; You have no space and no time only quick reaction.&nbsp; Now we take this scenario at night in your home or office.&nbsp; The lights are dim and the attack is on.&nbsp; Wing Chun asks \u201cwhat if\u201d so it trains its practitioner&#8217;s blindfold so understand the only thing you can rely on are the skills instilled in you by your instructor and training.&nbsp; By having even one hand on your assailant in a low light you can \u201cfeel\u201d where they are likely to attack.&nbsp; If the shoulder on one side moves in and down then the other is likely lifting and pulling back to hook punch.<\/p>\n<p>Most people chamber the center torso when attacking with kicks or punches and thus by touching one side of the body you can determine what the other is likely to do.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>This reactive force of pulling back to strike forward can be sensed by the practitioner versus the assailant and can give them a pre-indication of the assailants next intentions.&nbsp; Nothing is perfect, but any advanced drills and training in this subject is better than dismissing the value in low light fighting and reaction.&nbsp; If it can help then why dismiss it? Look at the logic behind it and see if it&#8217;s benefits would weigh training to gain application.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Wing Chun&#8217;s smaller compact&nbsp;movements and properly timed attacks are used to defeat much larger and stronger attackers. Through proper power, speed, balance and body structure a small amount of force can be precisely applied. Not only deflect powerful attacks but to open the opponents vitals momentarily to a devastating counter-attack. Instead of blocking then attacking as two separate movements, a Wing Chun practitioner will block and attack high and low at the same time. Techniques such as the Intercepting Fist \u201cCutting Arm\u201d otherwise known as \u201cTurning Punch\u201d can cut into and disrupt the structure and attack of an opponent while allowing the Wing Chun practitioner to overtake and re-root any resistance. Through proven positions of power, the Wing Chun practitioner opens a pathway to the core vitals of their opponent both inside and outside of the assailant. These techniques automatically deflect while a countering attack, punch and\/or kick is delivered. Thus the theory is that you may be able to block one, but both is improbable on a constant.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Don&#8217;t base Wing Chun off opinion,&nbsp; base it on your own observation of its techniques.
