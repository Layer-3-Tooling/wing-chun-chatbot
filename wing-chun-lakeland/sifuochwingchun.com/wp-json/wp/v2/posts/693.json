Our Lakeland Martial Art School is located in Lakeland Florida (Polk County) at 116 east pine street, Lakeland Florida<\/span><\/em><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Natural help for adhd \/ add through martial arts instruction<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">These days you don\u2019t have to look far to find children suffering&nbsp; from ADD, ADHD, and other sensory and mood disorders.&nbsp; Some have been&nbsp; carefully and expertly diagnosed.&nbsp; A large contingency of people feel&nbsp; that these diagnoses are handed out much too generously and without&nbsp; proper evaluation, however.&nbsp; A child can\u2019t sit still in his or her&nbsp; seat, and they are promptly labeled.&nbsp; Parent\u2019s are frustrated with&nbsp; speedy judgments and rightly so.&nbsp; But being desperate for help and&nbsp; worrying that their child\u2019s social life is soon to be suffering,&nbsp; some tentatively resort to medication.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">According to Medline Plus, a service of the National Library of&nbsp; Medicine, ADHD is more common in boys than girls, is hereditary, and&nbsp; symptoms must be present for at least six months for a true diagnosis&nbsp; to be considered.&nbsp; They also urge parents to get professional advice&nbsp; rather than making self diagnoses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The most common symptoms of ADHD are hyperactivity, inattention or&nbsp; short attention span, impulsivity, short temper, and organizational&nbsp; challenges.&nbsp; ADD is much the same, minus the hyperactivity.&nbsp;&nbsp; Interestingly, these characteristics are present only when children&nbsp; are disinterested in the topic that they are being required to give&nbsp; attention to.&nbsp; According to helpguide.org \u201cIt isn\u2019t that children&nbsp; with ADD\/ADHD can\u2019t pay attention: When they\u2019re doing things they&nbsp; enjoy or hearing about topics in which they\u2019re interested, they&nbsp; have no trouble focusing and staying on task. But when the task is&nbsp; repetitive or boring, they quickly tune out.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">As a teacher, it is especially challenging trying to make <em>every <\/em>lesson sufficiently interesting and varied so as to keep <em>all <\/em>children engaged at <em>all <\/em>times.&nbsp; Even when I do my best,&nbsp; it\u2019s often still not enough to prevent some \u201ctuning out\u201d.&nbsp;&nbsp; Children these days seem to lack the discipline it takes to stay in&nbsp; tune with their surroundings.&nbsp; Perhaps this is due to limited&nbsp; practice in doing so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">When I say discipline, I\u2019m referring to the following definition:&nbsp;&nbsp; \u201c<strong>training to<\/strong> <strong>act in accordance with rules<\/strong>;&nbsp; drill: military discipline\u201d. It can also refer to <strong>\u201cactivity,&nbsp; exercise, or a regimen that develops or improves a skill;<\/strong><em><strong> training<\/strong><\/em><strong>.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">My personal belief (which is shared by a majority of my colleagues)&nbsp; is that overstimulation with media plays a big part in this \u201cabsence&nbsp; of discipline\u201d for several reasons.&nbsp; Media is everywhere and easily&nbsp; accessible.&nbsp; Hand held games can be played while riding in the car.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kids text constantly, even while in class (says my son who shall not&nbsp; be named).&nbsp; The internet can be accessed by phone.&nbsp; What better way&nbsp; to keep kids quiet and entertained?&nbsp;&nbsp; It\u2019s an \u201cinstant oatmeal&nbsp; world\u201d as my husband calls it. How can we teachers compare to that?&nbsp;&nbsp; We\u2019re not animated, we don\u2019t have sound effects, and&nbsp; unfortunately for our students they can\u2019t \u201cturn us off\u201d when&nbsp; they\u2019re tired of us.&nbsp; Whatever happened to good old fresh air and&nbsp; sunshine?&nbsp; Climbing trees?&nbsp; Doing things as a family?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Over-use of technology is attributed to another growing concern when&nbsp; it comes to children: obesity.&nbsp; Statistics say that cases of&nbsp; childhood obesity are becoming more and more prevalent.&nbsp; Not only do&nbsp; extremely overweight children have to endure humiliation, taunting&nbsp; and teasing from peers, they are at increased risk for a myriad of&nbsp; health issues.&nbsp; Type II diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood&nbsp; pressure, and sleep apnea sound like conditions only an adult would&nbsp; have to suffer.&nbsp; However the occurrence of these health problems is&nbsp; increasing at an alarming rate.&nbsp; In addition, these children are at&nbsp; higher risk of developing, liver diseases, orthopedic problems and&nbsp; asthma.&nbsp; Many continue to struggle with their weight even into&nbsp; adulthood.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">No matter where you look for support,&nbsp; all sources will recommend some basic guidelines.&nbsp; Eat healthy meals&nbsp; in appropriate proportions, have healthy snack choices available,&nbsp; limit \u201cscreen time\u201d, and <em><strong>exercise daily. <\/strong><\/em>If you&nbsp; suspect that your child might be carrying too much weight you can go&nbsp; online to any BMI calculator website, plug in your child\u2019s&nbsp; information, and see how he or she measures up.&nbsp;&nbsp; BMI stands for Body&nbsp; Mass Index, is calculated using a person\u2019s weight and height, and&nbsp; is a fairly reliable indicator of body fatness for most people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Whether your child has a professionally evaluated case of condition&nbsp; \u201cX\u201d or simply has an overabundance of energy, why not consider an&nbsp; exercise program that is beneficial for children in general,&nbsp; ESPECIALLY those with specific needs, and for the whole family as a&nbsp; unit?&nbsp; Not as a cure, but as an aid to developing discipline, keeping&nbsp; weight in check, and increasing self-esteem<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">One obvious choice is martial arts.&nbsp; Of course while participating in&nbsp; any group activity the technology would have to be put aside for 30&nbsp; to 60 minutes.&nbsp; But tell your kids it will be well worth the&nbsp; sacrifice.&nbsp; They\u2019ll get all of the above benefits, and all the&nbsp; while have IMMENSE fun!&nbsp; Not all martial arts programs are the same,&nbsp; however.&nbsp; So how do you go about finding the right one?&nbsp; My advice as&nbsp; a mother of three and teacher of many is to actually go to a martial&nbsp; arts center; ask a lot of questions, watch an actual class.&nbsp; See what&nbsp; fits you\/your family best.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">There are several in Lakeland,&nbsp; including one that I\u2019m personally very fond of; <strong>Master Wing Chun&nbsp; Martial Arts<\/strong> <strong>on downtown Pine Street.<\/strong> What I like about&nbsp; this particular facility is their mission statement.&nbsp; Owner Justin&nbsp; Och boasts that his program offers Martial Arts with a purpose; <em><strong>practical skills<\/strong><\/em> rather than flamboyant moves are&nbsp; taught.&nbsp; He has been employed previously by other martial arts&nbsp; centers that teach \u201cfancy moves\u201d, kicks, and punches. This&nbsp; experience is what prompted him to open his own place.&nbsp; Adults and&nbsp; children alike will learn self defense moves.&nbsp; Adults will be taught&nbsp; to protect themselves from other adults; children against potential&nbsp; kidnappers and the \u201cchoke holds\u201d other kids might put on them&nbsp; (which Mr. Och says is becoming quite common).&nbsp; After people have had&nbsp; training in handling a sword or knife they\u2019ll know how to use it,&nbsp; not just twirl it around for show.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">I actually came across Master Wing Chun&nbsp; when seeking out guidance from an herbologist (Justin Och) for some&nbsp; health issues. I personally have not taken a class yet, but am&nbsp; anxious to do so after my daughter and I witnessed a class! We were&nbsp; so excited about signing up that we went home and told the rest of&nbsp; the family about it.&nbsp; Now, they want to try it as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Several classes are offered at <strong>Master&nbsp; Wing Chun Martial Arts<\/strong>, including Kung Fu, Kickboxing, Self&nbsp; Defense, Boot Camp and more.&nbsp; Everyone is welcome whether you are an&nbsp; adult, child, beginner or if you have experience in martial arts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seven to ten instructors are present during any given class, so&nbsp; personal attention is available at all times.&nbsp; Check out their&nbsp; website for pictures, videos, and details on classes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Sifu (meaning \u201cmaster\u201d or&nbsp; \u201cteacher\u201d- pronounced \u201csee \u2013 fu\u201d) Och is personable and&nbsp; friendly, yet at the same time he is quite intense, and passionate&nbsp; about sharing his knowledge.&nbsp; Not only is he a master at martial&nbsp; arts, he is a trained iridologist and herbologist, and can assist you&nbsp; with health and weight loss issues.&nbsp; After one conversation you\u2019ll&nbsp; realize that he offers a wealth of knowledge.&nbsp; If you happen to stop&nbsp; by while a class is taking place, be prepared to be impressed!&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are friendly, focused, and without a doubt thrilled to be&nbsp; there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Children reap the benefits&nbsp; and create healthy habits that will follow them throughout their&nbsp; lives:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>RESPECT:<\/strong> Children learn to bow&nbsp; to the masters who came before them, and to their current&nbsp; instructors. They also learn to treat other students as they wish to&nbsp; be treated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">According to parenting.com many&nbsp; parents whose children have ADHD state that their kids have had <strong>great&nbsp; success<\/strong> with these types of programs because <strong>self-control and&nbsp; concentration<\/strong> are the precise skills that need development.&nbsp; But,&nbsp; say experts, it&#8217;s the <strong>respect<\/strong> kids learn that can be the most&nbsp; important benefit: It often carries over into school, helping to&nbsp; improve behavior and even grades, according to recent research.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">R-E-S-P-E-C-T\u2026.As a teacher, that\u2019s&nbsp; GREAT news for me!&nbsp; It\u2019s Great news all the way around, actually.&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine less negative feedback and more positive feedback from your&nbsp; child\u2019s teacher.&nbsp; Imagine your child showing you and others more&nbsp; respect.&nbsp; Imagine your child bringing home better grades due to his&nbsp; increased ability to focus, and the self-pride that goes hand in hand&nbsp; with an impressive report card!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>FITNESS: <\/strong>The movements of the&nbsp; martial art itself often challenge your muscles and cardiovascular&nbsp; system. Martial artists are known for being toned, flexible and&nbsp; physically fit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>SELF DEFENSE:<\/strong> The ability to&nbsp; defend yourself against an assailant is an empowering feeling. Master&nbsp; Wing Chun Martial Arts uses self defense as a cornerstone of the&nbsp; entire program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>SELF DISCIPLINE<\/strong>: Martial&nbsp; arts help instill mental focus in your child, giving her the ability&nbsp; to concentrate on a task and see it through to its conclusion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>SELF&nbsp; CONFIDENCE:<\/strong> A child who is&nbsp; involved in martial arts is generally a child who is confident in&nbsp; herself. Martial Arts helps a child develop measurable goals to&nbsp; follow that are realistic to attain. The sense of accomplishment a&nbsp; child feels by mastering a new technique follows him everywhere he&nbsp; goes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"center\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Take the time to stop by and chat with&nbsp; Sifu Och.&nbsp; If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be missing out on an opportunity&nbsp; of a lifetime.&nbsp; As he puts it, \u201cThere\u2019s only so much time in a&nbsp; day.&nbsp; How are you going to invest it?\u201d&nbsp; He issues a warning,&nbsp; however:<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">ATTENDING&nbsp; WING CHUN MAY GET YOU IN THE BEST SHAPE OF YOUR LIFE, MAKE YOU A BETTER PERSON INSIDE AND OUT.
