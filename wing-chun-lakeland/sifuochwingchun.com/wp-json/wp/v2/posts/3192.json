Now Wing Chun is a lot different than any other art.&nbsp; I feel better with just one year so far of training in Wing Chun than I did with 28 years in Taekwondo.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve even become more focused and more capable in my fighting.&nbsp; It hasn&#8217;t been easy to ROOT, keeping your elbows in, and straight line punching but I see the benefit and the simplicity&nbsp; of Wing Chun. But it&#8217;s hard to break a lifetime of bad habits but I will keep on trying.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>SIFU JUSTIN OCH is very good at teaching and explaining every aspect of why a technique works or won&#8217;t work. I have learned a lot since I&#8217;ve been in Wing Chun.&nbsp; But I have a lot further to go to be where I want to be.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>Furthering my Testimonial to Sifu Och Wing Chun<\/h3>\n<p>My punches are more controlled, powerful, my body is more rooted, and I&#8217;m not (as much) off balance any more.&nbsp; My power has increased and my speed is better now then it has ever been before.&nbsp; I have gotten into better shape, just from Wing Chun and the blocks, punches and training.&nbsp; Chain punching by the way is fantastic at building muscle mass in the arms and chest. I have lost about 10-12 lbs in one year just from working out in Wing Chun blocking and attacking.&nbsp; My endurance and cardio has improved greatly.&nbsp; I still have a long way to go. I would like to be able if a fight breaks out, I just want to end the fight very quickly.&nbsp; I also want to be able to be good enough to not be hit that easily.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>My endurance, power, speed and cardio has improved greatly but I still have a long way to go.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>James Frazier<br \/>\nLakeland Now Wing Chun Kung Fu Academy<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com\">https:\/\/sifuochwingchun.com<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sifuoch\">http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sifuoch<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"mailto:sifuoch@facebook.com\">sifuoch@facebook.com<\/a><br \/>\n116 east pine street, Lakeland Florida<br \/>\n863.800.0171<\/p>\n<p>Facebook Group; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sifuoch#%21\/groups\/SifuOchLakelandWingChun\/\">http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sifuoch#!\/groups\/SifuOchLakelandWingChun\/<\/a><br \/>\nTwitter \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sifuochwingchun\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/sifuochwingchun<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>6th Dan Taekwondo Master, Now WING CHUN!!!
