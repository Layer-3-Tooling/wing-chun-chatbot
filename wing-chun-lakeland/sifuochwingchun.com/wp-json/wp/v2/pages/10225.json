This system of kung fu is known for its devastating close quarter combat techniques, direct, simple, devastating and aggressive strikes along the centerline which use the entire body as a weapon. <\/p>\n<p>Wing Chun Kung Fu history is rife with survival, self defense, and revolution. It was originally conceived by a woman who was a master in her own right of many Shaolin Kung Fu styles from the Sil Lum Temple. As the art was developed by her, it is also said that four of her Shaolin Monk Brothers (also masters of various Shaolin Systems) helped her to refine and complete the style we now call Wing Chun.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"hero-right\">\n\t\t<div class=\"hero-right-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"social-links flex\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a title=\"Instagram\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/sifuochwingchun\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"social-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"iso-8859-1\"?>\r\n<!-- Generator: Adobe Illustrator 16.0.0, SVG Export Plug-In .

Many Ming dynasty generals and prominent Chinese families sent family members to study at the Sil Lum Temple. Ming generals and high officials often sought the rigorous military arts training for their sons from the warrior monks of this Shaolin Temple. However, in the 17th century, political turmoil swept through China.

From intense research we have found clues that these students worked as a Red Boat Opera Troupe by day and anti-Qing revolutionaries by night.<\/p>\n<p>Their identities as Chinese opera performers provided a cover for martial arts training. The flashy moves of opera style martial arts, however, were not suited to the activities of espionage and assassination, which required extremely specialized skills.
