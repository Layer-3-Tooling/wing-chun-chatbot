					<description><![CDATA[<p>Sal Ficaro: Ageless Training is Sal message to anyone feeling "too old" to start something. Read his story to see things from his perspective. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sal Ficaro came to Sifu Och Wing Chun about one year ago. He tried one of our classes and got very frustrated with himself and decided to leave. Sifu Och was able to talk to him and arrange for private lessons instead to help him through those first steps of learning. When I took on Sal and his private lessons I knew this would be a difficult task. Sal was not used to Wing Chun and it&#8217;s movements. However, I knew that it could be done because Sal had the right mindset. In this article, Sal Ficaro: Ageless Training, Sal will tell a little bit about himself and his training here.</p>
<h2>Sal Ficaro: Ageless Training</h2>
<p>&#8220;Hello, my name Salvatore Ficarro I am 58 years old. I&#8217;ve been training at Sifu Och Wing Chun it&#8217;s been a learning process. Timothy Kittelstad is one of the trainers at this studio and he is absolutely wonderful. Even though the journey has been tough I absolutely love it.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8987 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104652/24139787_10214181889196289_1952524341_o-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104652/24139787_10214181889196289_1952524341_o-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104652/24139787_10214181889196289_1952524341_o-400x533.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104652/24139787_10214181889196289_1952524341_o-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104652/24139787_10214181889196289_1952524341_o-450x600.jpg 450w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104652/24139787_10214181889196289_1952524341_o.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />If anybody is in the 40s or 50s age and would like to learn some self-defense they should not hesitate. They should come down to Sifu Och and start their own journey! Your age shouldn&#8217;t hold you back. I&#8217;m 58 but that is just a number. I don&#8217;t allow that to be an excuse to not learn something new. Life can be very hard. And many times you want to just give up. But the wonderful things in life take some time to learn.</p>
<p>When you are working hard to learn something you may fall a little short. And when that happens, as long as you get back up and come back stronger that day was a success. There are days I feel I&#8217;m only at maybe 60% where I should be. But if I leave at 61% that means I am improving. Then next time maybe I&#8217;m at 70% or 80%. As long as you work hard and improve, no matter how small the improvement, you will always be able to grow. The staff at Sifu Och Wing Chun are the best trainers I&#8217;ve ever seen. They are their to help you. All they want is for you to be your best. And I want you to succeed. I feel if you give it a try your will fall in love with it.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Age doesn&#8217;t Stop Hard work</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8984 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104644/24008242_10214181889076286_390539567_o-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104644/24008242_10214181889076286_390539567_o-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104644/24008242_10214181889076286_390539567_o-400x533.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104644/24008242_10214181889076286_390539567_o-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104644/24008242_10214181889076286_390539567_o-450x600.jpg 450w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104644/24008242_10214181889076286_390539567_o.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />Sal shows that now matter your age you can accomplish anything with hard. Day after day Sal comes into class and puts in a hard days training. Starting from private lessons he has been able to work himself into the group classes. The most impressive thing about Sal is his determination. He doesn&#8217;t care about belts, or awards, or flashy techniques. He simply wants to know that he can take care of himself. Each day he comes in and builds himself from the last class.</p>
<p>Age is just a number. Everybody has hurdles they have to learn to overcome. Everyone has their own life story. Once you learn to accept your story and do the best you can with what you have you can start to really learn new things.</p>
<p>Instead of complaining about his age, or &#8220;not being able to move like he used to&#8221;, Sal trains his body to move the best it can right now. Because that&#8217;s what matters, the now. Not the past, not the future, but right now. What are you doing right now to make a difference in your life? If nothing than you should find the reason why. And then find a strong reason why you need to change that. Sal is a great example of someone who tackles life no matter what happens.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>My Journey Toward Wing Chun is Najai's story from Taekwondo to Wing Chun. It outlines his first exposure to Wing Chun as well as overcoming a tragedy. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>My Journey Toward Wing Chun</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: #454545;">My martial arts training started late in 2006 at Dan Parrish’s Taekwondo school.&nbsp; The sole purpose of me training there was for it to be an outlet for my anger issues. When my training first started, my attitude toward others, school, and life in general was horrible. At the same time that I was practicing Martial Arts, I was also regularly seeing a “Guidance counselor“ . With the help of my “guidance counselor“, my instructors at my Martial Arts school, and my parents… I was able to reduce the amount of anger I’ve always had and calm down as much as possible. </span></span></p>
<h2>Introduction to Ip Man</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: #454545;"><img decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7422 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/24103536/ving-tsun-history-1-300x216.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="216">As years went on I became a black belt at the same martial arts school but under a different instructor who’s name is Master Gary Hernandez. Around that time is when I watched the first Ip man movie. That’s when I wanted to start to learn any new style of Kung Fu, but Wing Chun in particular. Something terrible occurred I was working towards my 2nd degree black belt. A near fatal incident happened to my mother and now ex-stepfather.&nbsp; Once that happened, my training drastically went downhill. I wasn’t wanting to throw a single punch or block a single strike.<br />
</span></span></p>
<h2>Re-Focusing</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: #454545;">After a while, when I knew my mother would be OK I began to start training again. But this time I was traveling with a friend every Thursday and Saturday to Zephyrhills to continue my training. I was also training and teaching as one of the head instructors at my Lakeland taekwondo school. As 2014 was coming to A conclusion, my taekwondo school and Lakeland shut down because of financial issues which allowed me to become A full fledged student under Gary Hernandez. Once I became a student under Gary Hernandez I started training in the super foot system and earned my 2nd degree black belt<i>.&nbsp; </i>Soon after I received my next rank, I moved further away to the city of Winter Haven which kept me from training because of transportation issues.</span></span></p>
<h2>Lakeland Wing Chun</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: #454545;"> Fast forward towards 2016, I stumbled across the Wing Chun school in Lakeland. At the time I was very hesitant about walking in and asking questions because of the simple fact that I did not know how I would be able to make it to classes without there being A problem. I am glad to say that I do not regret walking into the front door. I met both the manager, Timothy Kittelstad, and the owner, Sifu Justin Och<i>.&nbsp;</i>They immediately made me feel welcome. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: #454545;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8786 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/24104441/Sifu-Justin-Och-Ip-Chun-son-of-Ip-Man-vtaa-300x216.jpg" alt="sifu justin och, ip chun, hong kong, florida, son of ip man, master" width="300" height="216">One of the many reasons why I love to train at this particular school is because of the authenticity of the Wing Chun that is being taught. There’s no place else like it, and there’s no other place that you can learn wing Chun from one person that’s been certified under multiple lineages. So far what I’ve gained and hope to continue gaining is the realness of Wing Chun and how the principles of Wing Chun affect more than just a persons martial art aspect<i>,&nbsp; </i>but also different aspects of every day life and activities. I’ve also learned and have gained many different techniques that is and will be always important to any true martial artist. </span></span></p>
<h2>Wing Chun&#8217;s Greatness</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: #454545;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8951 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104629/Naj-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104629/Naj-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104629/Naj-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104629/Naj-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104629/Naj-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104629/Naj.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Lastly, one thing I’ve gained since I’ve signed up at Sifu Och’s Wing Chun is the love and care that he provides and all of his students. Anyone who signs up will be able to experience the greatness and directness and effectiveness of Wing Chun. They will also be able to see how family oriented the school and the atmosphere is. They will also how hard and dedicated all the students are to their training.</span></span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>My Journey Into Wing Chun: Rich Dorsey. Rich gives his story about his journey training and where he came before Wing Chun.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;My Journey Into Wing Chun: By Rich Dorsey,&#8221; is my story hope you enjoy! </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I&#8217;ve wanted to train in the Wing Chun system specifically ever since I knew of it when I first got started in martial arts as early as my 18th year. My first teacher, a master of Isshin Ryu, was fascinated by it. Upon many of my homework assignments I received then I also was given information, literature and videos about Wing Chun. </span></span></p>
<h2>My Journey Into Wing Chun: By Rich Dorsey</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Those few Karate teachings were basic. I had only begun to scratch the surface of how to use my hands and feet. They are minuscule to the depth I&#8217;ve seen at this early stage of Sifu Och&#8217;s system. Even still I feel many significant differences in the fighting styles. Not only are both of my &#8216;weapons&#8217; straight-on utilizing more than half my body, but my hands (when I&#8217;m practicing my techniques properly) are continuously forward ready to be fired in short range fire attack. This being said I can honestly say I&#8217;ve never had any real training. Even though over the years I&#8217;ve tried many different styles of martial arts even boxing. </span></span></p>
<h3>My Inspiration</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7197 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/24103248/private-wing-chun-lessons-private-lessons-lakeland-florida-fl-210x300.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="300"></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri Light,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I&#8217;ve met many masters and many students but never anyone who has ever truly inspired me. I began to believe my dream of learning Wing Chun and meeting those kinds of individuals was out of reach. Not only did I find what I was looking for, I met one of the best fighters I&#8217;ve ever known. A teacher not only surpassing my expectations in knowledge but one who inspires me still. A system that not only challenges me but one that works. I&#8217;ve seen it work and have felt it work. To this day I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m more inspired by him or fellow students. Not only can I see what it&#8217;s done for myself but I see what it&#8217;s done for them. The changes in us all over the past two years.</span></span></p>
<h3>My Past</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">And before I go on about the many benefits of Sifu Och&#8217;s Wing Chun system it&#8217;s important to me to remember who I was before I came. I&#8217;ve been athletic my entire life. I began calisthenics at the age of five, and weight training as early as eleven. As an adult, I became a personal trainer by trade. My confidence was exuded for all to see. Yet there was always something missing. All my goals in my physical attributes had for the most part been met. I wanted more than just to look like I could kick butt and take names. I wanted to feel it and believe it.</span></span></p>
<h3>Refining Myself</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">So I began refining myself, my cardio respiratory and training on my own to prepare myself for martial arts. Had I known then what I know now I would have just started immediately. When I felt like I was ready that&#8217;s when I found him. &#8216;When the student is ready the master will appear.&#8217; I can honestly say I had no idea what true cardio was. And all the confidence -that I soon realized was only on the surface- was stripped away as soon as I realized how much I didn&#8217;t know. How much younger men (and some women) only half my size and strength could easily defeat me. Most only in the beginning phase of the system. The confidence that I have now runs deep.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<h3>My Future</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The cardio I currently have I could have never imagined. I&#8217;m tougher than I ever could&#8217;ve imagined. These are only a few of the benefits I&#8217;ve gained and being only a short distance along the long road I&#8217;ve begun to travel I can only imagine how much more there is in store for me here. The excitement only grows the more I learn, understand, and experience&#8230;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Sifu Och! WING CHUN!!</span></span></p>

Wing Chun a southern Chinese martial art mentioned during the period of the Red Boat Opera in the Late 1800s. Developed by southern Shaolin monks to help combat the Manchurians. It is influenced by other Fujian martial arts that preferred short steps and close fighting, with arms placed close to the chest and elbows close to the flanks offering protection. A simple boxing form quickly mastered by dedicated practitioners.</p>
<p>Two key figures keeping Wing Chun system alive after the burning of southern temples were Yat Chum Dai Si, 22<sup>nd</sup> generation Siu Lam Grandmaster monk, and Cheung Ng, also known as Tan Sao Ng within the opera. It was taught to other rebels taking refuge with the opera. From there it spread along the coast and rivers of south-eastern China by people who lived by and on the water. The Shaolin nun myth was most likely created to protect the identities of the creators and perpetrators of the Wing Chun system. Wing Chun translates to Spring Chant or Spring Praise.</p>
<h2>Tony Plasse: Becoming an Orange</h2>
<p>I remember my first introduction to Wing Chun Kung Fu was an Ip Man movie three years ago. Did not know much about it, but the movie inspired me to research it. I liked the theory behind and thought it would be more practical for myself. High flying kicks, although cool looking, are not my style. When I finally had the opportunity to attend a class near my house I thought to myself, &#8220;this is great&#8221;.</p>
<h3>My Reaction</h3>
<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>I <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7290 size-full" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/24103358/tony-plass.jpg" alt="" width="297" height="236">have spent the last year training with Sihing Garret and I have noticed improvements in myself. Garret emphasizes physical training at the beginning of each class. I have improved muscle tone and stamina. Wing Chun techniques taught to me have improved my reflexes much to my surprise. Not just in wrist against wrist but in everyday applications. I react to things such as doors flying at my face. I caught one once with a Jum Sau action. The lady next to me said “Wow! That was like a ninja!”. I also catch the items knocked off shelves with a lot more ease.</p>
<h3>My Confidence</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8148 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/24104036/Tony-Plasse-Wing-Chun-Kung-Fu-Tampa-Bay-Florida-153x300.jpg" alt="Tony-Plasse-Wing Chun Kung Fu Tampa Bay Florida" width="153" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/24104036/Tony-Plasse-Wing-Chun-Kung-Fu-Tampa-Bay-Florida-153x300.jpg 153w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/24104036/Tony-Plasse-Wing-Chun-Kung-Fu-Tampa-Bay-Florida.jpg 221w" sizes="(max-width: 153px) 100vw, 153px" />The wrist against wrist drill has helped my sensitivity improve into reaction. It has given me more confidence in handling myself. I always knew my normal movements gave me power. But now I am learning to channel that power more efficiently through stance and technique. I am more confident that I’m more prepared for situations when I’m out on the town or at work. I believe there are many applications I could have used previously in my life as a football player. Namely the footwork and center line punch drill. Both would have greatly helped me as an offensive lineman and coach. It also adds to my overall scariness.</p>
<h3>My Future</h3>
<p>As the days grow closer to my son’s birth, I look forward to sharing Wing Chun with him. I hope he will benefit from Wing Chun training developing skill, balance and confidence. I see Wing Chun as an opportunity to develop father and son bonds.</p>
<p>The instruction and encouragement I receive is outstanding. Sihing Garret and Sifu Och inspire me to dedicate myself and continue training. I hope to be an inspiring instructor one day. I look forward to progressing and to be a good representative of Tampa Bay Wing Chun Kung Fu and Sifu Och Wing Chun.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Road to Orange: By Dixon Kwok. Before getting in to Wing Chun, I never had much martial arts training. I took Tae kwon do for a bit but my mom pulled me out not long after I got my yellow belt. This was due to her reading an article that said doing martial arts stunted growth. I personally never believed it, but I was only in I think elementary school and it’s not like I could convince her otherwise.</span></span></p>
<h2>Road to Orange: By Dixon Kwok</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> After that I never gave martial arts much thought. Even so I’ve always enjoyed sports and athletic activities so I’ve pretty much tried every sport one could think of over the years. However, because I changed interests so much, I never really joined a team and received formal training. The exception to this was swimming only due to my parents will and not my own. Because of this I grew up to be a rather athletic and coordinated person and learned things rather fast and quickly. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Since I did keep switching between sports depending on what was on TV I lacked commitment and because I was usually playing by myself or with friends. I would just stop whenever I got tired or didn’t feel like continuing. This led me to lack motivation to push through when things got too hard because there was no one to force me to keep going and push my limits.</span></span></p>
<h2>My Inspiration</h2>
<figure id="attachment_8847" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8847" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-8847 size-full" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/24104503/Dixon-2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8847" class="wp-caption-text">Dixon Kwow Training for His Orange Sash Test</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> A little over a year ago though, I was watching a TV show and one of the characters saved a stranger through the use of martial arts. It sparked a whole new interest in martial arts for me. I talked it over with my friend and he seemed like he was interested in learning a martial art too. Which would be something we could to together.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> Seeing&nbsp;how I’ve pretty much already finished growing I didn’t see a reason my mom would not allow me to take a martial arts now. So I figured it wouldn’t hurt to ask and try out martial arts again. Sure enough she gave me the ok.So I started researching which martial arts I wanted to do. I looked over the usual ones most would hear about in this day and age like Karate, Tae Kwon Do, Boxing, etc. After a bit of research though I decided I wanted to do one that was closer to my birthplace Hong Kong.</span></span></p>
<h3>Searching for the Right Style</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> From that I started up looking for styles of Chinese martial arts. I stumbled upon a site that listed a whole bunch of styles of Kung Fu. These were split into northern and southern styles. So I looked through the southern styles and see Wing Chun. When I looked at its main points and realized it’s very in line with what I’m interested. Being more direct, relying on speed to wear down the opponent. As opposed to a huge powerful blow to end it all. Strong and no flashy stuff that is often more likely to look cool than actually work in a fight. As I did more research, I found out it was also the martial art that Bruce Lee and Ip Man practiced. This helped me get a better idea of what it looked like and how it was executed. I decided to go ahead with this one.</span></span></p>
<h2>My Beginning</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">My friend ended up getting interested in something else and dropping out of our plan. I figured I would do it regardless. Now a little over a year later as I test for my orange sash I am very happy with my choice. The class has become like another family. I can come and progress each week and also have good times with. There is an atmosphere that makes me want to keep pushing and get better and better. Although morning classes on Saturday are often really rough, it’s often worth it.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I’m glad to be learning Wing Chun in this system as unlike many other systems. It is focused on making us fighters instead of belt chasers. It isn’t about just getting to the next belt but making sure I’m actually capable of holding my own. That is why I wanted to learn a martial art in the first place. This has been an incredible journey so far and I will keep going as far as I can.</span></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Growth in Wing Chun</h1>
<p>Where to Begin? Growth in Wing Chun. &nbsp;<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-8586 alignright" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104323/growth-in-wing-chun-lakeland-fl.jpg" alt="Growth in Wing Chun lakeland Fl" width="226" height="400" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104323/growth-in-wing-chun-lakeland-fl.jpg 226w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104323/growth-in-wing-chun-lakeland-fl-170x300.jpg 170w" sizes="(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px" />Where does one begin divulging the effervescent determination surrounding my growth in Wing Chun under the Sifu Och lineage. As well as the growth in myself. Ultimately the scrupulous truth would be in my young age of six when I as many martial artist has divulged found my passion for martial arts watching Enter the Dragon featuring Bruce Lee.</p>
<p>It was my favorite movie to re-watch and practice the moves of in my mom’s living room. From that moment on I knew I wanted to learn more about Bruce lee but also learn more about martial arts. Growing up we didn’t have much extra money so my passion laid with tutorial videos, school wrestling team, and books explaining how to train and learn new moves or techniques.</p>
<h2>Ip Man was released in the united states</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-8587 alignright" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104325/growth-in-wing-chun-kung-fu.jpg" alt="Growth in Wing Chun Kung Fu lakeland Fl" width="226" height="400" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104325/growth-in-wing-chun-kung-fu.jpg 226w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104325/growth-in-wing-chun-kung-fu-170x300.jpg 170w" sizes="(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px" />Fast forward to the important part, the year 2009 when the film Ip Man was released in the united states red box system, I was helping my grandpa move when he out of kindness decided to rent a movie for me and my brother. He casually strolls in and I will never forget what he said “you Know you guys have worked real hard and I wanted to show a small gesture of appreciation, I know you both love martial arts so I saw a film on Bruce lee’s master in red box and thought it would be interesting for you to check out.”</p>
<p>Little did I know that night after years of watching, reading, and jumping styles when able I would find my passion and my growth in Wing Chun. I watched the film and fell in love with the pure flow of combinations, relentless ferocity in each hit and it wasn’t flashy but it was unprecedentedly fast and effective. I begin with this prelude only to set the proper background for why I study as hard as I do and why I have such an appreciation for every moment I spend learning something in Sifu Och Wing chun.</p>
<h2>Years of Martial Arts Fanaticism</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-8589" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104330/growth-in-wing-chun-lakeland-florida-sifu-och.jpg" alt="Growth in Wing Chun Kung Fu lakeland Fl" width="300" height="216">In my years of martial arts fanaticism and study I have trained in my styles of course seeing as I have landed in Sifu Och Wing Chun never were for very long. The complete breakdown would be six months of high school wrestling, a month of Muay Thai, a month of Goju-Ru karate, and Six months of Sport Judo.</p>
<p>These many styles that I bounced around in were necessary, they allowed me to gain a proper understanding of what most martial arts schools were about.&nbsp; The schools primarily focused on the money, they would show you a couple moves leave you on your own and then after a bit would ask if you want to join up.</p>
<p>This was an industry standard I did not like, so I often parted ways, if I wasn’t sure I maybe stuck around for a bit to maybe see if I was judging to quickly or harshly. I feel that my jumping styles did in fact help me grow as a martial artist however the training only took me so far and let’s be honest it wasn’t very far at all. I still had nervousness in fighting situations or even in confrontational situations. My&nbsp;Growth in Wing Chun has only begun.</p>
<h2>Sifu Och Wing Chun has been a Blessing</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-8590 alignright" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104333/growth-in-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-florida.jpg" alt="Growth in Wing Chun Kung Fu lakeland Florida" width="300" height="216">Sifu Och Wing Chun has and will always be a blessing to me, it’s not simply a school to learn how to defend yourself, for me it’s so much more. To elaborate in greater detail and analysis it’s a family that helps me when im struggling, it’s a support group to help me further grow as a martial artist however the training only took me so far and let’s be honest it wasn’t very far at all. I still had nervousness in fighting situations or even in confrontational situations.</p>
<h2>Not Simply a school to learn how to defend</h2>
<p>Sifu Och Wing Chun has and will always be a blessing to me. &nbsp;Its not simply a school to learn how to defend yourself, for me it’s so much more. To elaborate in greater detail and analysis it’s a family that helps me when I’m struggling. &nbsp;It’s a support group to help me further my physical and mental goals. It’s also the one place in the world where I feel myself separate from my troubles. First note I am going to touch on is the benefits of the training I receive from Tampa wing chun and Lakeland wing chun with my martial arts growth.</p>
<h2>Nervous when entering a physical confrontation</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-8588 alignright" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104327/growth-in-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-fl-2.jpg" alt="Growth in Wing Chun Kung Fu lakeland Florida" width="226" height="400" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104327/growth-in-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-fl-2.jpg 226w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104327/growth-in-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-fl-2-170x300.jpg 170w" sizes="(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px" />When I began a little over a year ago I was nervous when entering a physical confrontation however from the moment I joined (Like literally Day One) I was put into wrist vs wrist. This automatic exposure with the accommodations of the further advanced students I could not only overcome the fear but also conquer it.</p>
<h2>Now I love sparring</h2>
<p>Now I love sparring and wrist vs wrist and when situations outside in my daily life seem to be escalading I don’t worry, I am able to keep a level head. This allows for proper understanding of my surroundings and better problem solving analysis. Sifu Och wing chun also gives realistic defense training, where in other schools I have found what felt like rigid motions that are supposed to at some point just become natural, sifu och wing chun has offered close quartered and naturally fast movements that take your body no time to understand and implement.</p>
<p>It may take years to perfect or tweak to get it in the state you most desire but in the beginning, you already see significant differences. Second I also found a school that talks to each other, where older more intimidating students walk up to the newbies and say hello, give praise while also offering helpful criticism instead of sink or swim.</p>
<p>My Growth in Wing Chun is a place place where I feel at home. &nbsp;You are not judged and where only growth is possible, growth of the self, growth of the heart, and growth of body and mind. Nowhere I have crossed paths with has ever come within striking range of what is offered. All of what I wrote hopefully explains why I love what I do at Sifu Och Wing Chun. &nbsp;Why I drive 2 and a half hours for private lessons, tests, classes, and get together. &nbsp;The dream of one day offering a place of sifu och wing chun, where I end up when I become Sifu.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>wing chun difference</h1>
<p>The wing chun difference&nbsp;for me started at Sifu Och Wing Chun about a year and a half ago and couldn’t be happier that I did. Prior to Wing Chun, I had practiced Karate for ten years and had already fallen madly in love with the martial arts. The Karate that I do incorporates a mixture of Tung Su do, Aikido, and Jujitsu and is infinitely different than Wing Chun. But when I moved to Lakeland for school, I knew that I had to find somewhere new to practice. As a broke college student, I also knew that I couldn’t really afford to train, but I really couldn’t afford not to. After doing a trial month at Sifu Och Wing Chun, I decided that I had to make it work.</p>
<h2>First Weeks of Training wing chun difference</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-8561" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104319/difference-in-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-florida.jpg" alt="wing chun difference lakeland florida" width="226" height="400" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104319/difference-in-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-florida.jpg 226w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104319/difference-in-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-florida-170x300.jpg 170w" sizes="(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px" />The first two weeks of training I was extremely cautious and suspicious of everything that Sifu taught. It was so different from everything I knew, that at first it felt like it couldn’t possibly be right.</p>
<p>But over those two weeks I grew to trust Sifu and appreciate Wing Chun as a martial art. Now whenever I feel like something isn’t right, it’s usually because I’m doing it wrong. Wing Chun is so different than <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/karate-and-wing-chun-share-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Karate</a> that it took a lot of getting used to. I constantly wanted to use my legs and felt trapped in all the hands only combat that they focus on in beginner Wing Chun.</p>
<p>Though I was reluctant to rely heavily on them, hand work was something that I desperately needed to improve. Another major difference that messed with my head was how <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/reader-question-wing-chun-sparring-tips/">Wing Chun fights </a>squared up instead of sideways. I had to constantly force my back shoulder into a square position effectively distracting me – but I quickly learned to love having both hands up and in front of me.</p>
<h2>Karate girl Learning to Love Wing Chun</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-8560 alignright" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104317/infinite-difference-in-wing-chun-lakeland-florida.jpg" alt="infinite wing chun difference lakeland florida" width="226" height="400" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104317/infinite-difference-in-wing-chun-lakeland-florida.jpg 226w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104317/infinite-difference-in-wing-chun-lakeland-florida-170x300.jpg 170w" sizes="(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px" />Learning to love Wing Chun was a struggle at first. Because some of the techniques were contrary to my first love of Karate, it felt a little bit like betrayal. I had been training Karate for ten years! For the past five years, I had been teaching and instructing the art that I love. Now suddenly I was at the bottom of the food chain, knowing absolutely nothing about Wing Chun – it was a hard transition to say the least, but one well worth making. I was soon able to respect and appreciate each art for their differences, and have started down the road of incorporating them both.</p>
<h2>First couple of months in Training</h2>
<p>Learning Wing Chun in and of itself is hard. For the first couple of months I was very confused in my training. &nbsp;Trying to keep up with all the Chinese terminology and different techniques. It took about 2-3 months for my confusion to subside and for me to feel comfortable, performing all the moves that I’d learned.</p>
<h2>Too many give up to quickly</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, a lot of people give up in those first few months feeling like they won’t ever get it. Every single person that I got my first sash with has left as well, and it is so sad! What I have learned from Wing Chun has been exponentially beneficial to almost every aspect of my life. <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-8558" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104313/karate-vs-difference-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-fl.jpg" alt="karate vs wing chun difference kung fu lakeland fl" width="300" height="216">My overall health and fitness has improved including strength and endurance. My mental health improved as well, relieving the stresses of daily life in class every night. This year I started a very emotionally draining internship dealing with girls that have been sex trafficked. &nbsp;Wing Chun allowed me to refrain from going insane and relieve my frustration.</p>
<p>I would recommend Sifu Och Wing Chun to anyone that wants to be able to protect themselves. &nbsp;If you want to better their health, and make friends – and who doesn’t want that? &nbsp;You should be down here training.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Tampa Bay Asia Fest FIGHT Demo &#8211; Sifu Och Wing CHun kung Fu</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">This years Tampa Bay Asia Fest&nbsp;had a fight present, one that challenged the skills of Sifu Justin Och and his Central Florida schools. Tampa Bay Asia Fest had a lot going on that day. &nbsp;From the wonderful Asian food vendors that come each year to show case their culinary skills. &nbsp;To the art work inspired by the cultures of China, Japan, Malaysia and even Thailand were present. &nbsp;<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">IF YOU LIKE KUNG FU MOVIES, Watch it ALL THE WAY THROUGH!</span> </strong></p>
<div style="position: relative; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><iframe loading="lazy" style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; left: 0;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m4LCqj4Ei-E?rel=0?ecver=2" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Most Noteworthy, the ENDING is Completely UN-CHOREOGRAPHED</span>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The day started out with all of these vendors coming together showcasing their regional cuisine. &nbsp;Sifu Och Wing Chun kung fu group started practicing early for the event. &nbsp;They were a special guest demonstration on stage for Tampa Bay Asian Fest.</p>
<h2>TAMPA BAY ASIA FEST FIGHT DEMONSTRATION BY SIFU OCH WING CHUN</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8657" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24104356/Tampa-bay-asia-fest-sifu-och-wing-chun-students-entertainment-134x300.jpg" alt="Tampa bay asia fest sifu och wing chun students entertainment" width="134" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24104356/Tampa-bay-asia-fest-sifu-och-wing-chun-students-entertainment-134x300.jpg 134w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24104356/Tampa-bay-asia-fest-sifu-och-wing-chun-students-entertainment-268x600.jpg 268w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24104356/Tampa-bay-asia-fest-sifu-och-wing-chun-students-entertainment.jpg 285w" sizes="(max-width: 134px) 100vw, 134px" />Once the speakers were ready, it was the Sifu Och Wing Chun Kung Fu group turn to go on stage at the Tampa Bay Asia Fest. &nbsp;They started with the Wing Chun first form, <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/wing-chun-forms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sil Lum Tao</a> or Siu Nim Tao. &nbsp;Then they transitioned into first year students demonstrating their sparring and reaction ability. &nbsp;Then moved onto intermediate level students, ones that have only been in between 3-5 years. &nbsp;In addition they moved onto one of our youngest brown sash instructors Neckodemos Davidson. Davidson fought and sparred in the Wing Chun Kung Fu Demonstration against multiple attackers.</p>
<p>Furthermore our <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/instructors/sifu-justin-och-chief-wing-chun-instructor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chief Instructor Sifu Justin Och</a> of Lakeland, Florida headquarters and Senior <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/instructors/sihing-garret-brumfield-2nd-level-wing-chun-instructor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">instructor Garret Brumfield</a> perform. &nbsp;They started with the <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/ip-man-fact-or-fiction-wing-chun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grandmaster Ip Man</a> long pole form. &nbsp;Long pole is also called&nbsp;luk dim boon kwan&nbsp;or dragon pole. &nbsp;<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8659" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24104400/Tampa-Bay-Asia-Fest-Sifu-Och-Wing-Chun-Kung-Fu-entertainment-134x300.jpg" alt="Tampa Bay Asia Fest Sifu Och Wing Chun Kung Fu entertainment" width="134" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24104400/Tampa-Bay-Asia-Fest-Sifu-Och-Wing-Chun-Kung-Fu-entertainment-134x300.jpg 134w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24104400/Tampa-Bay-Asia-Fest-Sifu-Och-Wing-Chun-Kung-Fu-entertainment-268x600.jpg 268w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24104400/Tampa-Bay-Asia-Fest-Sifu-Och-Wing-Chun-Kung-Fu-entertainment.jpg 285w" sizes="(max-width: 134px) 100vw, 134px" />Immediately after this they started fighting in&nbsp;Chi Sau reaction sparring. &nbsp;This was without any choreography. &nbsp; It was evident nothing was staged with these two as they demonstrated their free style reaction sparring, within <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/chi-sao-sticky-hands-drilling-in-wing-chun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chi Sau</a>, for the crowd. &nbsp;Crowed were amazed as the action was packed all the way through. &nbsp;At the end of this demonstration the Sifu Och Wing Chun central florida group left the stage only to be asked by staff if they could do more.</p>
<h2>Tampa Bay Asia Fest Performance</h2>
<p>Prior&nbsp;to the <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/contact-sifu-och/lion-dance-dragon-dance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragon dance performance</a> starting&nbsp;the Sifu Och Wing Chun Kung Fu group, both the Tampa Bay Florida branch and the Lakeland Florida branch practiced along side the Hillsborough River. &nbsp;As spectators rolled in they spar and fight one another to build up their energy and the enthusiasm <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8658" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24104358/Tampa-bay-asia-fest-sifu-och-wing-chun-students-134x300.jpg" alt="Tampa bay asia fest sifu och wing chun students" width="134" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24104358/Tampa-bay-asia-fest-sifu-och-wing-chun-students-134x300.jpg 134w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24104358/Tampa-bay-asia-fest-sifu-och-wing-chun-students-268x600.jpg 268w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24104358/Tampa-bay-asia-fest-sifu-och-wing-chun-students.jpg 285w" sizes="(max-width: 134px) 100vw, 134px" />of the crowds walking inside of Tampa Bay Asia Fest. &nbsp;Instructor Garret Brumfield and Master Instructor Sifu Justin Och both train Dragon Pole (luk dim boon kwan) and Chi Sau sparring while onlookers wait and watch in anticipation.</p>
<p>Also the rest of the Sifu Och Central Florida Wing Chun Kung Fu group spar and fight to build reaction before the big demonstration takes place. Most of all, the group loves to train so any excuse to do so is a good one for <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com">Sifu Och Wing Chun students.</a></p>
<h2>Asia Fest Shaolin Kung Fu demonstration</h2>
<p>Though once the skills from another <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/modern-shaolin-weapon-training-the-wing-chun-fighter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shaolin Kung Fu </a>group called Mt. Song started, the <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8660" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24104402/tampa-bay-asia-fest-kung-fu-entertainment-wing-chun-florida-134x300.jpg" alt="tampa bay asia fest kung fu entertainment wing chun florida" width="134" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24104402/tampa-bay-asia-fest-kung-fu-entertainment-wing-chun-florida-134x300.jpg 134w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24104402/tampa-bay-asia-fest-kung-fu-entertainment-wing-chun-florida-268x600.jpg 268w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24104402/tampa-bay-asia-fest-kung-fu-entertainment-wing-chun-florida.jpg 285w" sizes="(max-width: 134px) 100vw, 134px" />Sifu Och Wing Chun kung fu group stopped and ran over to watch in support. &nbsp;The Mt. Song Shaolin kung fu group put&nbsp;on an amazing lion dance and Kung Fu weapon demonstration. &nbsp;This demonstration was most noteworthy by the graceful and fluid movements of their students. &nbsp;Not withholding the final demonstration which consequently left the audience stunned. &nbsp;One of the students bared his body to the breaking of wooden sticks. &nbsp;With one last strike to his inner thigh while he was upside down (making it appear as though his groin would get the blunt of the blow) &nbsp;his thigh took the break instead.</p>
<p>Most noteworthy, the <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/contact-sifu-och/lion-dance-dragon-dance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragon dance</a> that was placed on that day was especially fun as they travelled the length of the event gathering all&nbsp;those around for the festivities about to begin. &nbsp;The style of the dragon dance reminds you of the Great Wall of China as the dragon spins and curves to follow the golden ball. Chinese drums engulfed the air as they are beaten in the background.<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8622 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24104337/asia-fest-1-e1495740064160-178x300.jpg" alt="Tampa Bay Asia Fest Fight Sifu Och Wing Chun Kung Fu Florida" width="178" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24104337/asia-fest-1-e1495740064160-178x300.jpg 178w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24104337/asia-fest-1-e1495740064160.jpg 202w" sizes="(max-width: 178px) 100vw, 178px" /></p>
<p>There was also J-pop dance performances, Asian fan dancing and even a short unspoken Asian cultural play that had many characters that expressed interpretive thought, feeling and ideas through method&nbsp;acting.</p>
<h2>Representing Southern Shaolin Kung Fu system; Sifu Och Wing Chun Kung Fu team</h2>
<p>Representing the Southern Shaolin style of Kung Fu for Tampa Bay Asia Fest, enters the Sifu Och Wing Chun Kung Fu Team. They were approached by the Tampa Bay Asian fest judges to return representing Wing Chun Kung Fu for the next Tampa Bay Asian Fest festivals. <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-8629 size-medium alignright" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24104353/asia-fest-2-1-e1495741808946-172x300.jpg" alt="Tampa Bay Asia Fest Fight Sifu Och Wing Chun Kung Fu Florida" width="172" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24104353/asia-fest-2-1-e1495741808946-172x300.jpg 172w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24104353/asia-fest-2-1-e1495741808946.jpg 246w" sizes="(max-width: 172px) 100vw, 172px" />Their engaging performances, following years demonstrations, of this Southern Shaolin Kung Fu style have earned them the title. &nbsp;We we&#8217;re&nbsp;honored to demonstrate at the Tampa Bay Asian Fest. &nbsp;This great event will&nbsp;showcase authentic southern shaolin Wing Chun Kung Fu. &nbsp;Broadening audiences horizons on the benefits and practicality of the ancient art of kung fu. With the Mt. Song Shaolin Kung Fu and the Sifu Och Wing Chun they will provide&nbsp;guests with great Kung Fu entertainment. The up coming years at Tampa Bay Asia Fest will&nbsp;have some of the best kung fu entertainment and food around! &nbsp;Don&#8217;t miss Tampa Bay Asia Fest next year, you will regret it if you do.</p>

More than that, however, they got to see the Lakeland Chinese Lion Dance Team in action at the Polk Museum of Art.</p>
<p>People&nbsp;stood at the front of the Lakeland, Florida Polk Museum of Art. They&nbsp;heard there would be a Chinese Lion Dance performance here in Lakeland, Fl and the Museum was having a Family Day, so they couldn&#8217;t&nbsp;resist. &nbsp;They waited and watched, looking for some clue of the <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/lakeland-chinese-lion-dance-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lakeland Chinese Lion Dance </a>Team.</p>
<p>In the distance a&nbsp;drummer approached and laid down a large Chinese Lion Dance drum in front of the crowd outside the Polk Museum of Art.&nbsp; Everyone was waiting to see what was about to happen as they lined up around the corner to get in to this once a year event. The Drummer lifted two large sticks into the air and broke&nbsp;the silence&nbsp;with an authoritative beat!&nbsp;The crowd looked and peered around the corner, something large and red was in the distance. The Chinese Lion Dance had begun!!!&nbsp; The bright red lion danced among the crowd, jumping, dancing, prancing and cuddling up to each participant waiting for the doors to be opened so they could get the full performance!</p>
<p>The children played with and teased the lion, laughing and loving every moment of the performance.&nbsp; Parents with huge smiles looked down at their children with the same wonder and amazement.&nbsp; The Chinese Lion Dance drums thundered away with the height of the excitement!</p>

<p>The Chinese Lion Dance continued as the Chinese lion performers scratched at the door of the Polk Museum of Art, the&nbsp;performers sympathizing&nbsp;with the line of parents and kids waiting for the Family Day event to start!</p>
<p>Chinese and Asian traditions have an ancient culture with live Chinese Lion Dance performances that chase away bad luck, evil intent and instead bring good luck, prosperity and fortune for the coming years.&nbsp; No matter how many times you have seen the Chinese Lion Dance as performed by Sifu Och&#8217;s Wing Chun Kung Fu – Lakeland Lion Dance Performance Team it is always a memorable and exciting experience to say the least!</p>

<h2>Customized Chinese Lion Dance Team Event</h2>

<p>Wing Chun Kung Fu is a Southern Kung Fu style and is taught by Sifu Och in Downtown Lakeland Florida.&nbsp; Sifu Och teaches the Southern Lion Dance and performance which is characterized strong based stances, fast sharp movements and fun playful crowd pleasing antics.</p>
<p>The practice of Kung Fu requires strong training, dedication and an ability to know distance, and structure.&nbsp; With the prowess and experience to test the limits of endurance and demonstrate a wonderful live performance using this rare Asian tradition.</p>
<p>The Lion Dance is extremely taxing on the performers and thus the practitioners are professionals with high trained endurance while developing and maintaining intense concentration.</p>

<p>More than just a school, the <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/about-sifu-och-wing-chun/dr-sifu-justin-och-biography/">Sifu Justin Och</a> crew is an extended family to all those who are dedicated to this amazing close combat system known as Wing Chun Kung Fu. Sifu Justin Och Fishing Trip met up with his students looking to have under the sun as a group taking a break from rigorous training from the kwoon in downtown lakeland florida.</p>
<p>From crab traps to fishing lines, this Wing Chun school does more than just training they have fun with each other, taking in life and living every moment.</p>
<p>Assembling for angling, crab chasing and an extraordinary retreat&nbsp;under the hot Florida sun, the group of understudies and&nbsp;Sifu Justin Och&nbsp;built&nbsp;fellowship, solidarity, and camaraderie.&nbsp;From kwoon to excursion, we like to think that-as a family-Sifu Och Wing Chun is about buiding relationships, enjoying life together, and helping each other grow together and learn from each other.</p>
<p>Thank you, Sifu Justin Och for having a Wing Chun school that looks beyond just training and self defense to a place where both friendship&nbsp;and fun&nbsp;come together.</p>

<p>The Sifu Och Wing Chun Lakeland <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/lakeland-chinese-lion-dance-performance/">Lion Dance and Dragon Dance team</a> did a wonderful Chinese New Year celebration and show at Downtown Lakeland&#8217;s&nbsp;Exploration V Museum. There was quite the crowd both inside and outside of the museum this last weekend as the Sifu Och Wing Chun Kung Fu&nbsp;team&nbsp;performed the Chinese Lion Dance with authentic Chinese live music and drums. The performance had leaps, tail chasing, children running and laughing-as well as a few kids who got to get&nbsp;inside the dragon and perform along with the Chinese New Year celebration event.</p>
<p>Sifu Och and the Chinese Lion Dance team performed all of this, donating their time for the benefit&nbsp;of the downtown Explorations V Museum. It was a wonderful event and show for the good luck and prosperity of both businesses in the new year. Sifu Och Wing Chun Kung Fu cares&nbsp;about kids development and safety and you can&#8217;t beat&nbsp;the fun a HUGE red dragon jumping, playing, and running amuck&nbsp;outdoors!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in having a Chinese Lion Dance perform for your Chinese New Year, birthday party or special event, contact Sifu Och Wing Chun&nbsp;at <a href="mailto:sifuoch@facebook.com">sifuoch@facebook.com</a>.</p>

<p>Our Lakeland, Florida-based Sifu Och Wing Chun Kung Fu team took the challenge of the Warrior Dash 5K. We found ourselves leaping over live embers and fire and then dropping down and crawling through deep wet mud&#8230;and that was jut the beginning!</p>
<p>Crawling under barbed wire and getting low and dirty, our team of guys and gals felt right at home, pushing through the miles scaling wood walls&nbsp;and&nbsp;climbing up and over chain ropes. We waded through dark soaked muddy water up to our chests (which happened to also be as cold as ice) and then ran through sand to our next checkpoint. We had to work both&nbsp;foot and eye coordination as we ran&nbsp;and moved through laid out tires and ran over smashed cars-stepping on the hood, top, and trunk of the vehicles trying to keep our balance.&nbsp;It was a dirty event, with plenty of mud and dirt&#8230;but there&#8217;s nothing quite like it!</p>
<figure id="attachment_2282" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2282" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/24101843/IMG_2098.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-2282" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/24101843/IMG_2098-300x200.jpg" alt="sifu och wing chun warrior dash kung fu lakeland florida" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/24101843/IMG_2098-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/24101843/IMG_2098-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/24101843/IMG_2098-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/24101843/IMG_2098.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2282" class="wp-caption-text">Sifu Och Wing Chun&#8217;s Garret Richardson was one of the competitors in the Warrior Dash&nbsp;5K race.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, we couldn&#8217;t forget that after that we&nbsp;still had to climb a net of ropes to get to the top of a platform, then climb down before running up and down large hills! Balancing our bodies on beams of small plywood was next, all while jumping over water-soaked fences!&nbsp;Oh, and did I forget to mention this was all&nbsp;with water spraying and gushing down on us&nbsp;from above!</p>
<p>All in&nbsp;all, this was an amazing time.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Make your next special&nbsp;event even <em>more&nbsp;</em>special with a Chinese Lion Dance Performance</p>
<p>At first glance, the Asian Bamboo Gardens at the Jacksonville Zoo seemed to be an ideal place for families to rest, relax, and reflect. Yet little did they know a huge lion was lurking in the Bamboo Mist Forest, ready for action.</p>

<dd class="wp-caption-dd">Lakeland Florida Chinese Lion Dance Team&nbsp;led by Sifu Och Wing Chun</dd>
</dl>
<p>Luckily for zoo visitors, this lion wasn&#8217;t a real threat, but the intricately costumed Chinese Lion Dance performers from the Sifu Och Wing Chun studio in downtown Lakeland. In March 2009, the talented Sifu Och Lion Dance team performed seven shows in just two and a half&nbsp;days to celebrate the grand opening of the zoo’s Asian-themed section, featuring Komodo dragons and over 70 other animal species unique to the Far East.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Sifu Och lion dance was fantastic,” said an advisory board member from the Jacksonville Asian American Alliance. “I’m from Singapore, and coming from the Orient, the lion dance is very important if you have something new that opens up. These guys did a fantastic, phenomenal job and made me feel right at home.”</p></blockquote>
<p>During their performances which spanned the entire garden, including stunts at the Lotus Pool and Weeping Tree Bridge, children and their parents would closely follow the lion, curious about what it would do next. Families would cheer when the lion executed a series of difficult stunts and laugh when it would tease particular audience members. One time, for instance, the lion tried to steal a musician’s gong!</p>
<p>Lion dances play an essential role in Chinese folk culture as many believe the performances chase off evil spirits while bringing good luck, happiness, and prosperity. In fact, the first recorded Chinese lion dance performance dates back to third century B.C. during the Han Dynasty. These choreographed routines can only be performed by the most advanced Kung Fu practitioners since the coordinated running, leaping, and jumping movements require much strength, stamina, flexibility, balance, and body control.</p>
<p>Justin Och, the leader of the Sifu Och Wing Chun Chinese lion dance team, has over 13 years of experience executing the acrobatic techniques necessary for an entertaining show. His commitment to the craft makes his Chinese lion dance team one of the most successful and sought after in Central Florida. His team has performed at numerous Asian weddings in Orlando, Tampa, Maitland, Kissimmee, and Brandon, and at museums in Bradenton, Sarasota, St. Petersburg, and Lakeland. In addition, public Sifu Och lion dance demonstrations are conducted throughout the year, especially during the Chinese New Year. Most recently, the Sifu Och team performed at the Family Day event at the Polk Museum of Art in September.</p>
<p>This Lakeland Florida-based Chinese lion dance team will perform at any wedding, birthday party, business opening, or special event, and will match any competitor’s price. In addition, Sifu Och will work closely with you to build a custom choreographed show that will bring joy to all involved. Several packages are available starting at $499-799 for local shows (within 20 miles of Lakeland with reasonable increases in prices for further travel). Seasoned Chinese musicians are also available to enhance your Chinese lion dance experience with drums, flutes, gongs, and cymbals. Final price depends on location and size of show. Bring the lion dance to your next special event.</p>
<p><em>Make your next event special with a Chinese Lion Dance Performance.</em></p>

<p>You can only be nominated by a high standing member of the council or elite martial artist that is already a long standing presence and affiliate.&nbsp; Even then the council looks over your videos, record and history in the martial arts and if approved you are inducted, but this is never permanent. The Eastern USA international black belt hall of fame has the right, that if you do not show the highest caliber of respect and martial art intent they can revoke your entrance.&nbsp; Though you would have to truly disrespect others with your actions or show poor intention to be recommended for discharge it has happened over the years.&nbsp; The right and privilege of being a part of the Eastern USA international black belt hall of fame is not bought but earned.</p>
<blockquote><p>So many martial artists can buy there way into a&nbsp;false &#8220;black belt hall of fames&#8221;, all they need do is send in a email, call or fill out a card and they are in.&nbsp;&nbsp;Worse yet with other false &#8220;black belt hall of fame&#8221; ceromnies you get to pay and recommend yourself for whatever award they give you.&nbsp; OH yes, you get to fill out what you want and they just hand it to you because you paid them to.&nbsp; You get to join because you asked them, they found you in the yellow pages or online.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>A True Hall of Fame isn&#8217;t a solicitation &#8211; </strong>The Eastern USA international black belt hall of fame is exclusive, you can only be nominated in by a respected member that vouches for your skill, integrity and intention with the martial arts.</p>
<p>No you can not recommend yourself for an award or nominate yourself for an award.&nbsp; Though if you are a nominated good standing member of the Eastern USA international black belt hall of fame you can recommend your students nominations as their Chief Instructor, owner and leader of your style.</p>
<blockquote><p>Only other&nbsp;high standing&nbsp;associates or high council members can make a recommendation to the Eastern USA international black belt hall of fame council on what award, if any award at all, you should receive that year.</p></blockquote>
<p>No you cannot pay to get in, you can not recommend yourself only a good standing member who can vouch for your integrity, skill and intent can nominate you.&nbsp; After nomination it is then up to the council to vote and approve or discharge your nomination.</p>
<p>No one tries or attempts to sell you on Billing or other services, this is not a ploy hall of fame that invites you then attempts to sell you.</p>
<p><em>You can not buy your way in to this USA international black belt hall of fame, you will never recieve a letter, email or note by currier or mail,cannot buy your way in to this USA International Martial Arts Association, this is an elite black belt hall of fame, you will never receive a letter, email or note by currier or mail, you cannot ask to be invited or walk in and be part of this.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211; Dr. Grandmaster John Kanzler &#8211; President of the Eastern USA International Martial Arts Association (EUSAIMAA)</p>
<p>You will never get a solicitation email, mail, call or anything else as this is a real black belt hall of fame and not a sales pitch.</p>
<p>It does not cost more to become a higher standing member only training, proof&nbsp;of skill, integrity, honor&nbsp;and time make you a higher standing member.</p>

<p><strong>I write this&nbsp;because &#8211;</strong>&nbsp;My name is <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/about-sifu-och-wing-chun/dr-sifu-justin-och-biography/">Sifu Justin Och</a>, I am writing this because after being a part of the the Eastern USA International Martial Arts Association and Black Belt Hall of Fame I have been offered, solicitated and called by corporate fake&nbsp;hall of fames looking to make money off me, my students and school, sell me on billing or attached to a billing company in the hopes I&#8217;ll switch over or other hall of fames that don&#8217;t care about the martial artist just the money they can make by SELLING you a false yearly title.&nbsp; I despise these round about ego boosting sales pitches and a true hall of fame has nothing to do with these solicitation&#8217;s and sales pitches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, we want you part of our hall of fame, just pay&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;We know you&#8217;re an elite martial artist, we&#8217;re going to send you a hall of fame induction letter&#8230;&#8221; Though they have no clue as to what you have or haven&#8217;t done.&nbsp; They make the recommendation over the phone or &#8220;Dear elite martial artist&#8221; letter. This is not a true martial arts hall of fame and people should know the difference especially because there are so many of these out there handing out awards and wall plaques.</p>

<p><strong>My nomination, vouch and&nbsp;recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Don McNatt joined my school and trained for about a year before he pulled me outside.&nbsp; Up until that I thought here is a tough old guy who really wants to train.&nbsp; I knew nothing about his past, his previous training or his knowledge base.&nbsp; He kept secret until early 2009 where he pulled me out side.&nbsp; He first started talking to me about recommending me for the Black Belt hall of fame.&nbsp; I honestly but respectfully blew it off,&nbsp; I think I actually said &#8220;thats nice of you but don&#8217;t worry about it I just like to train.&#8221;&nbsp; He then said I have watched you and would really like to recommend, vouch and nominate you.&nbsp; At that point I said &#8220;oh, alright what like send them an email or something, don&#8217;t worry about the hassle.&#8221;&nbsp; To me at the time I was looking at this older guy who never revealed or showed any of his previous knowledge or training in class over the past year.&nbsp; He literally emptied his cup and trained in Wing Chun without trying to incorporate any of his previous training.</p>
<blockquote><p>I thought this is just a tough old guy who really loves martial arts, maybe as another hobby, boy was I off.</p></blockquote>
<p>In Fact Dr. Don McNatt is the State of Florida representative for Okinawa and Japanese Karate as a 7th Dan Shotokan Okinawa Karate Grandmaster and high standing council member with the Eastern USA International Martial Arts Association and Black Belt Hall of Fame.&nbsp; Starting Boxing in 1950 at a boys club, Judo practitioner at Florida Southern College, joined the US MARINES, traveled to Japan.&nbsp; He trained under Sensei Fumio Nagaoka in Yokohama in Shin Kage Ryu Jujitsu and Shotokan Karate.</p>
<p>Then five miles east of Hiroshima trained in Wado Karate, Sensei Hitoshi Akiyama, he was captain of the first team of foreigners to participate in the 1963All Japan Karate Team Championship tournament in Tokyo. He was the only foreigner to compete in the JKA tournament in Fukuoka at that time.&nbsp; Was fortunate to train under some of JKA’s (Japan Karate Associations) greats such as M. Nakayama, H. Akiyama and became personal friends with K. Enoeda, Y. Yaguchi, T. Mikami, H. Shirai, Sensei Tatsao Suzuki, T. Okazaki, Arnis Fred Lazo, Praying Mantis under Sifu Roger Hagood and the list goes on.&nbsp; (for his full bio please go here).&nbsp; His vouch and recommendation was approved and I have grown through this wonderful association.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I am vouched for by many international and national Martial art and Wing Chun instructors and stylists from all over the World. A ranked and recommended Sifu and instructor of the Wing Chun system.</p>

<p><strong>Honor of E.U.S.A.I.M.A.A. Black Belt Hall of Fame &#8211;</strong> We have had the honor of being apart of their yearly gathering where practitioners and instructors from every style come together and share friendship and knowledge.&nbsp; Each year 16-19+ seminars happen in one weekend and are all included at no charge.&nbsp;The E.U.S.A.I.M.A.A. has instructors that provide their time, knowledge and skill from all over the world in every martial art imaginable. These international instructors fly in and gather to share and relate through training, student enhancement, high level training and survival.&nbsp; The only thing you cover is your dinner, hotel, and flight, the rest the association sets up, pays for and takes care of.</p>
<p>This is a true USA International Martial Arts Association and Black Belt Hall of Fame and I am proud to be apart of it.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211; Dr. Sifu Justin Och</p>
