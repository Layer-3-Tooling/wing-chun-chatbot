										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wing Chun is not the easiest martial art to teach. The techniques come from a philosophy and list of principles. Due to this, the application of the techniques can be done with many variations that can be considered &#8220;correct&#8221;. These variations can cause added frustration. This is due to the details when it comes to teaching the variations. So that being said, you need to give ample attention to your students to genuinely help them understand, learn, and apply their Wing Chun. Sifu Och&#8217;s three sections of teaching his main classes help accomplish that.</p>
<h2>Sifu Och&#8217;s Three Sections of Teaching</h2>
<h3>Beginner Class</h3>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-9136 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/24104747/women-wing-chun-kung-fu-class-training-high-block-biu-sau-punch-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-florida-usa-300x200.jpg" alt="women wing chun, kung fu, women wing chun class, high block, biu sau, punch, wing chun kung fu, lakeland, florida, usa, women wing chun kung fu" width="300" height="200">The beginner class is for those students that are within their first year of training. We typically have one main instructor on the floor who has trained for at least 3 years. He or she helps the new student&#8217;s build their fundamentals. The focus of this section of class is to build their immediate ability to stop basic, common attacks. In our article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/when-to-teach-wooden-dummy-chi-sao/">When to Learn Chi Sao &amp; Wooden Dummy</a> we cover in more detail what our philosophy is for that class. We want to make sure that when a student leaves our doors the are able to hand dangerous situations as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Much like a building we must set the groundwork. Within someones first year of training we teach them the basics to a few things. First, we guide them through the basics of footwork. Second, while building their footwork we help them through the concepts of using two hands at the same time. Thirdly, we want to build an attacking mindset. Instead of being focused on the perfect counter, block, or defense, we want our students to build an immediate offensive mindset.</p>
<h3>Intermediate Class</h3>
<p><a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/sifu-ochs-three-sections-teaching/wing-chun-coach-training/" rel="attachment wp-att-9230"><img decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-9230 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-scaled.jpg" alt="Coach Level Training, Wing Chun Combos, Wing Chun Timing" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-800x533.jpg 800w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>For our Intermediate class we move past our basic footwork and attacks and start building our combinations. After initial contact you must follow up to finish your opponent. Building on the foundation of attacks we begin to teach students how to effectively and efficiently follow up.</p>
<p>Not only do we build in the ability to follow up and finish an opponent we also begin to lean heavier into reaction training and sparring. There are three main stages of development which I go into more detail in my article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/the-3-training-cycles-of-martial-arts-tips-for-the-beginner/">Three Cycles of Martial Art Training</a>. The last of these stages is reaction which is the hardest to master. Speed, technique, power, all mean nothing if you do not have the correct timing.</p>
<p>Conner McGregor said &#8220;Precision beats power, and timing beats speed&#8221; in a post fight interview. You can take this one step further and say that without any form of timing you cannot fight. So you MUST develop your timing. Wing Chun is very effective when used properly. But due to many attacks being intercepts versus blocks, learning the timing can be tricky. You must devote consistent hard work in sparring and active attacker training.</p>
<h3>Advanced Class</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7095 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/24103144/Long-Pole-Weapon-Fighting-or-Dragon-Pole-300x200.jpg" alt="Wing Chun Long Pole, Weapons, Wing Chun Instructor" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/24103144/Long-Pole-Weapon-Fighting-or-Dragon-Pole-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/24103144/Long-Pole-Weapon-Fighting-or-Dragon-Pole-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/24103144/Long-Pole-Weapon-Fighting-or-Dragon-Pole-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/24103144/Long-Pole-Weapon-Fighting-or-Dragon-Pole-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/24103144/Long-Pole-Weapon-Fighting-or-Dragon-Pole.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>At our advance class level we begin the refinement of the techniques. We being teaching and using the Wooden Dummy at this level. Now that there has been years of using the Wing Chun shapes and applying them against pressure we can now upgrade them to the fullest level.</p>
<p>The Wooden Dummy training helps conditioning of the arms as well as tightening of form. Since the dummy does not hit back it serves no purpose other than that refinement of techniques. Spacing, shapes, rooting, all can be worked on using the dummy.</p>
<p>When at the advanced class we now also pass on the more traditional aspects of Wing Chun including Long Pole and Butterfly Swords. Wing Chun needs to stay applicable to the current martial arts you might run in to. However, you must keep your roots strong in the history of your training. Now that your training is coming full circle we finish the circle with advanced techniques and weapons.</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/when-to-teach-wooden-dummy-chi-sao/">When to Learn Wooden Dummy &#038; Chi Sau</a> appeared first on <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com">Sifu Och Wing Chun</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learning martial arts is much like a knife. You will take your training through stages before you can use it. The two main stages involved are crafting the knife and sharpening the knife. When to Learn Wooden Dummy &amp; Chi Sau depends on your view point in regards to these stages. I will speak from the perspective that I was taught at Sifu Och Wing Chun. That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that it is the &#8220;correct&#8221; way, it is simply how we do it here.</p>
<h2>Knowing when to teach Wooden Dummy &amp; Chi Sau</h2>
<p>Stage 1 &#8211; The view point that is at Sifu Och Wing Chun is one based in immediate application. When a student walks into our door we want to teach them street applicable techniques as soon as possible. We have had multiple students come into our studio living in dangerous situations. Our first advice is always to get away from the situation or people causing the problems. But when it comes to the techniques we can&#8217;t teach them Chi Sau or Wooden Dummy because at that moment it is not applicable.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2561" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2561" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-2561 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/24102023/IMG_5447-300x200.jpg" alt="women's self defense in lakeland florida women self defense sifu justin och wing chun kung fu martial arts" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/24102023/IMG_5447-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/24102023/IMG_5447-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/24102023/IMG_5447-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/24102023/IMG_5447-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/24102023/IMG_5447.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2561" class="wp-caption-text">women&#8217;s self defense in lakeland florida women self defense sifu justin och wing chun kung fu martial arts</figcaption></figure>
<p>They must be able to deal with dangerous situations and attacks immediately. We want to equip them with a basic defense against hooks, hard straight punches, take-downs, pushes, grabs etc. Once they have an established based we want to add onto their skill by adding combinations, transitions, and working against and with weapons. Finally, free sparring to train you on how to use and deal with other martial arts combat reactions.</p>
<h2>The Need for Chi Sau</h2>
<p>Now, the argument might be made that without Chi Sau it will be difficult to enhance certain aspects of your reflexes. To this I agree to a point. In Chi Sau you deal with close quarter sensitivity reaction as well as redirection and close range trapping. So it is a vital aspect of training Wing Chun.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-4181 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24102505/lakeland-fl-self-defense-lakeland-fl1-300x182-300x182.jpg" alt="wing chun classes" width="300" height="182">However, for the new student, Chi Sau may be difficult to use as a tool. You must train Chi Sau to learn structure before using it for reaction. Making sure that you have constant forward energy, balanced strength, and good relaxation can takes weeks to months of hard training.To fill in the gab between sparring and Chi Sau we use wrist against. This is essentially Chi Sau reaction hands without the rolling.</p>
<p>The same is essentially true with the wooden dummy. But instead of referring to reaction the wooden dummy would deal with structure and positioning refinement.</p>
<p>Stage 2</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7055 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/24103123/grandmaster-ip-chun-eldest-son-of-ip-man-sifu-justin-och-hong-kong-china-300x216.jpg" alt="grandmaster ip chun, Ip Chun, eldest son of ip man, ip man, sifu justin och, hong kong china" width="300" height="216">Stage 2 can be equated to the sharpening of the knife. You now have a good solid foundation in your techniques. You know how to apply them and it what situation they should be used. Now we must work to make them stronger, easier, more efficient. This is the perfect place for Chi Sau and Wooden Dummy. With the correct context in mind when applying the techniques, the refinement of them now has a purpose.</p>
<h3>The Knife</h3>
<p>Reverting back to the knife analogy. Imagine having a slab of metal and sharpening one side of it. Now, what do you have? A slab of metal with a sharp end. There is no way to use it as desired. Building the knife takes time. The handle, the guard if wanted, the length. You must make this part of the knife first before you can sharpen it. If you do not you are not only going to have a much hard time sharpening it but you will have an unusable knife.</p>
<p>Now, this goes without saying, all of the above depends on your goals. If you are seeking to learn Wing Chun to find balance in your life. Develop your mind and find new friends, then learning these aspects of Wing Chun sooner than later makes sense. However, if you are looking for the combat of Wing Chun then saving that for later is suggested for When to Learn Wooden Dummy &amp; Chi Sau.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Intercepting is always better than blocking. We are going to look at what the definition of intercepting is before we give some practical ways of accomplishing that. Webster&#8217;s dictionary defines intercepting as &#8220;to stop, seize, or&nbsp;<a class="mw_t_a_link" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/interrupt">interrupt</a>&nbsp;in progress or course or before arrival&#8221;. The best way to view intercepting is that last part of the definition, &#8220;interrupt&#8221;. Not only is the attack itself being interrupted, but the timing of your opponent should be as well. And that is the key, the timing. When timed properly your opponents attack will be nullified and you will be primed to launch a second attack (in theory before his second) or you would have already hit him. Now that we have addressed what intercepting as a concept let me provide you with&nbsp;4 Ways to Intercept your opponents attacks using Wing Chun.</p>
<h2>4 Ways to Intercept</h2>
<h3>Intercepting Fist</h3>
<figure id="attachment_9018" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9018" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-9018 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104722/25625458_10214390795338812_1361328337_o-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104722/25625458_10214390795338812_1361328337_o-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104722/25625458_10214390795338812_1361328337_o-768x576.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104722/25625458_10214390795338812_1361328337_o-400x300.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104722/25625458_10214390795338812_1361328337_o-600x450.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104722/25625458_10214390795338812_1361328337_o.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9018" class="wp-caption-text">Intercepting Fist</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em;">The first technique we will go over is the Intercepting Fist. Made famous by Bruce Lee, this technique is typically taught fairly early on in student&#8217;s training. The idea is to counter the opponents punch with a punch of your own. By keeping your elbow down and pressing from center mass you are elbow to offset your opponents strike. This can quickly be follow up a flurry of punches we refer to as Chain Punches. Keeping the strikes down the center you are able to maintain control of your centerline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em;">When you substitute a Paak Sao with an intercept you will find it can be much easier to deal with a second and third punch. Part of this is due to the fact that you are returning the opponents punch with a punch. They will be slightly less confident with their next punch as opposed to when you simple deflect their initial punch with a Paak. Second to that, the Intercept automatically covers your opposite side incase of a second attack. Whereas the Paak leaves you more open.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>The Turning Punch basically the other side of the same coin referring to the Intercepting punch. The Intercepting fist is typically used to refer to the lead hand being used with the lead foot to interrupt the opponent. This is illustrated in the first photo above.</p>
<p>Turning punch is simply using the the same structure but opposite hand to accomplish the same goal. Since the punch is coming from the back foot, the turning punch will have more power and torque then the straight Intercepting. However, much like the Paak punch, if not used properly, can leave you open on the inside for an attack.</p>

<h3>Tan Sao</h3>
<figure id="attachment_8459" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8459" style="width: 201px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-8459 " style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104212/17917075_10212076512923198_254854088_o-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="268" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104212/17917075_10212076512923198_254854088_o-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104212/17917075_10212076512923198_254854088_o-400x533.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104212/17917075_10212076512923198_254854088_o-768x1025.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104212/17917075_10212076512923198_254854088_o-450x600.jpg 450w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104212/17917075_10212076512923198_254854088_o.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8459" class="wp-caption-text">Tan Sao</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Tan Sao is a very effective and sound way to intercept a strike. You have not only nullified the attack but you have also almost guaranteed a strike of your own. Tan and the actual punch are the exact same shape. The only exception is what the hand is doing at the end. You can see here in the photo the Tan Sao is an hand open towards the ceiling. By opening the hand the focus of the technique is diverted to the elbow. The Punch itself can be delivered to the head, or for a taller opponent you can strike the ribs.</p>
<p>Since the Tan extending through the strike towards your opponent, it makes stopping a second strike fairly straight forward. You can transition to a Paak Punch if the Strike is down the center. Or, you can continue pressing forward with a Bui Sao against a hook punch.</p>
<h3>Paak Punch</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_8427" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8427" style="width: 197px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-8427" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104146/17901892_10212042861041922_1811866813_o-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="197" height="262" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104146/17901892_10212042861041922_1811866813_o-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104146/17901892_10212042861041922_1811866813_o-400x533.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104146/17901892_10212042861041922_1811866813_o-768x1025.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104146/17901892_10212042861041922_1811866813_o-450x600.jpg 450w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104146/17901892_10212042861041922_1811866813_o.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 197px) 100vw, 197px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8427" class="wp-caption-text">Paak Punch, Kick</figcaption></figure>
<p>Our last technique for this article on intercepting attacks is the Paak Punch. Clearing the attackers hit with Paak good, but combining it with straight punch is better. Since the Paak is coming off of the back foot there is a lot of power and structure with this counter. The Paak is also quite diverse.</p>
<p>When used, you can use the Paak to press forward and crush the attackers structure. You can guide his hand downward if he is taller. You can also use it to setup a baiting for the second punch.</p>
<p>Bonus: The Paak Punch is also a great attack to throw in a kick along with it. By doing this you maximize Wing Chun&#8217;s ability to use multiple weapons at once. You can see here in the photo, Sifu Justin used the Paak, Punch, and Kick. He uses the kick just before the punch clears the arm to finish the attack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>When it comes to Intercepting timing is everything. You can have GREAT structure, technique, and power. But, if you do not practicing your techniques in LIVE sparring scenarios you will get hit no matter how good you think you are. There is no substitute for hard work, and good punches to the face. Train hard and never give up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Comparing martial arts has been happening for ages. It has it&#8217;s benefits but if not done with respect it has it&#8217;s pitfalls. Before I get into my article I want to clarify this article is a technical analysis of the two styles. It is not designed to bash either still but to show how one style would deal with the other. Wing Chun Vs. Tae Kwon Do is a hot topic because of how wide spread Tae Kwon Do is and the rising popularity of Wing Chun. &nbsp;This article will hopefully give some insight into the two styles if someone is looking to train in one of them.</p>
<h2>My Wing Chun Vs. Tae Kwon Do</h2>
<p>Having started in Tae Kwon Do and now studying Wing Chun I use both in my training. Wing Chun is used as my primary art which I train against other ex Tae Kwon Do practitioners. I then return the favor as the “bad guy” helping my Wing Chun family against my Tae Kwon Do. Needless to say I have much experience using the two arts against each other. I will first address using my Wing Chun against Tae Kwon Do.</p>
<p>Wing Chun seeks to destroy the enemy as quickly as possible. Using structure and an overwhelming wave of attacks the aim to not give your opponent a chance. But to be maximized it must close the distance and keep it closed. Trapping can be utilized, which to someone who doesn&#8217;t grapple or know any counters, can be detrimental. The issue can be found in closing that distance. One of the most useful tools I employ is making sure I attack with at least two weapons.</p>
<h3>Entry</h3>
<p>Kicking while either blocking or intercepting an attack is a favorite. With my the Wing Chun structure keeping both hands and at least one foot in range allows me to hit multiple points at once. This disrupts most peoples timing. This also serves to slow down my opponent if he is very mobile. A stomping kick (or what we refer to as a Shadow Kick) to the thigh usually does the trick.</p>
<h3>Understanding the Opponent</h3>
<p>A Tae Kwon Do fighter will try to use his reach and distance. Switching kicks quickly can be tricky to deal with. However, if directness is maintained it won&#8217;t be a problem. Front kicks can be dealt with by using a Bui Ma step with a Gan Punch to clear the kick. A back up option is simply dropping the lead elbow on the ankle of the opponent. Round houses are usually stopped using a Double Jum Sao followed up with a back fist or chop. Because of the structure of Wing Chun once the distance is closed the opponent usually doesn&#8217;t have much of a response.</p>

<h2>My Tae Kwon Do Vs. Wing Chun</h2>
<p>When fighting another Wing Chun student the hardest part, as mentioned above, is the directness.<br />
I must keep my distance and rely on speed, fakes, and mis-directions to even come close to landing a good strike. Using my lead foot I will fake low and go for a head shot. This is one of the most effective strikes if I time it properly. Second to that a spinning back kick can be slipped under the protecting hands of a Wing Chun Fighter if executed quickly enough.</p>

<p>The hardest part again, is keep the Wing Chun fighter away. Quick movement in and out, outside hook heel kicks, and low to high kicks are the best options.</p>
<h2>Which One</h2>
<p>Of the two systems I do prefer Wing Chun for combat.. Even though the Tae Kwon Do fighter might be more mobile, the Wing Chun system provides a more sound answer to attacks. Based on my experience Wing Chun allows me to end a fight much more quickly which to me is the most important part.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have just begun your training in martial arts you know it can become very frustrating. You can feel lost in the material. Confused on a technique.

In this article, 3 Training Cycles of Martial Arts, we will explain a concept that will hopefully help you push past the first slump.</p>
<h2>The 3 Training Cycles of Martial Arts</h2>
<p>There are 3 basic stages of learning a new technique. Once you understand these stages you will be able to identify where you are and what you need to work on. What you must understand is everyone develops different. Some learn the initial technique faster than others. Yet those same students may struggle in applying it. Everyone learns different. You must accept where you are so you can focus on YOUR development. Don&#8217;t stress about the progress of others. That being said, lets look at these 3 stages.</p>
<h3>Stage 1: Programming</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7794 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/24103714/learn-self-defense-now-300x200.jpg" alt="learn self defense now" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/24103714/learn-self-defense-now-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/24103714/learn-self-defense-now-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/24103714/learn-self-defense-now-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/24103714/learn-self-defense-now-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/24103714/learn-self-defense-now.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The first stage of training begins with programing. This is exactly like installing a new system into a computer. It takes time. When a new technique is shown it comes with a new set of motor functions the body is not used to. To overcome this the body needs time to &#8220;program&#8221; the new function into the &#8220;hard-drive&#8221;. Some students are more prone to certain techniques. Maybe they grew up doing a certain sport that had a similar movement to what they are learning now.</p>
<p>For instance, in Wing Chun there is a lot of rooting through the heels. If someone spent a lot of time lifting growing up they might be able to grasp that concept a little quicker. As opposed to someone who played soccer for instance. They would have been taught to always be in their toes. Therefore, they would need to spend more time teaching their body to draw power from the heels then the first person.</p>
<h3>Stage 2: Application</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7856 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103757/Developing-the-Student-Mindset-300x200.jpg" alt="Developing the Student Mindset" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103757/Developing-the-Student-Mindset-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103757/Developing-the-Student-Mindset-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103757/Developing-the-Student-Mindset-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103757/Developing-the-Student-Mindset-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103757/Developing-the-Student-Mindset.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Secondly, after you have learned what the new technique is and how to perform it you must learn WHEN to perform it. This is called application. One technique can have many applications and then variations from that original. Applying the technique must also be treated like the programing because you are learning how to time it against an attack. You must be attacked over and over again to get the timing down.</p>
<p>Along with timing the technique another very important part of application is learned and testing: structure. Without structure a block or attack will be ineffective no mater the timing. Just like gold is refined in fire so must the structure of a technique be refined through the fire of pressure. Pressure testing your structure helps develop your shapes that shadow training (or practicing in the air) can never do. Real attacks must be thrown and you to really develop your structure. Combining the timing and pressure training will give you the ability to fully apply your techniques.</p>
<h3>Stage3: Reaction</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8764 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104425/20273304_10213122446550885_1533157015_o-1-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104425/20273304_10213122446550885_1533157015_o-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104425/20273304_10213122446550885_1533157015_o-1-400x533.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104425/20273304_10213122446550885_1533157015_o-1-768x1025.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104425/20273304_10213122446550885_1533157015_o-1-450x600.jpg 450w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104425/20273304_10213122446550885_1533157015_o-1.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />Thirdly, the final stage of developing your technique is reaction. You have could structure and timing, but how will your fair when you do not know when the attack is coming? Reaction is the hardest part of training. You must build one technique at time. Learn how to react to one certain attack. Once you have dealt with that you build again from step one. Program a new technique; apply it to real attacks; react to it in a sparring scenario. You must learn how to deal with skilled and un-skilled attacks. Single attackers and multiple attackers. As well as Feinting, counter striking, grappling, High-low hit combos. All of these things and more must be thrown at you.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this cycle must be repeated over and over again. Day by day, technique by technique, this must be done. Consequently, if you stay consistent with your training you will master every technique given to you.</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/importance-of-martial-art-forms/">Importance of Martial Art Forms</a> appeared first on <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com">Sifu Och Wing Chun</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">The form, or kata, is present in almost every possible martial art. Each art will, however, vary in how much emphasis and time it spends working on these forms. Some martial arts incorporate them, but do not place much emphasis on perfecting them; while others will spend a great deal of their time working on mastering all their forms. Either way, forms are an essential part of martial arts – yet an often underappreciated one. We will explain Importance of Martial Art Forms here.<br />
</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">What is a kata?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8813 " src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/24104445/kata-236x300.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="234" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/24104445/kata-236x300.jpg 236w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/24104445/kata.jpg 394w" sizes="(max-width: 185px) 100vw, 185px" /></span>“<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">Kata” is a Japanese word that literally translates into “form” in English. At its core a form is simply a sequence of martial art techniques, or one side of a choreographed fight. The main goal of a form is to preserve and drill techniques for new and future generations of practitioners. The idea is that you learn a multitude of skills while executing your art’s blocks and strikes. These blocks and strikes then become your muscle memory and are much easier to execute in a sparring or fighting scenario. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">When is it used?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">Present day forms are often used in demonstrations and competitions. For competitions, judges will score on a ten point scale that is usually given after all competitors have demonstrated their form. That way they can compare competitors against each other and score them accordingly. In days past, forms were used as military drills or as a sign of defiance towards the government. The forms were sometimes used with weapons and empty hand to drill fighting techniques in soldiers. While in other areas, the form was done after a long day of enslavement to show slave drivers that they could not break their spirit. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">What skills do we gain from forms?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">Practicing forms has the opportunity to offer many benefits. The most obvious being the learning and drilling of a new technique or sequence. One must do forms repeatedly, giving the practitioner ample time to work on mastering the skill. Some forms are more focused on centering the mind of the practitioner and preparing them for the class they are about to enjoy. These forms will appear more meditative and will warm up the necessary muscles for class. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">Enhancement of overall martial art skill</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">There is also a subset of skills that practicing forms enhances in any martial artist. This includes power, breath control, focus, precision, and muscle memory. Power comes through the repetition and learning how to add torque and core strength behind your strikes. Breath control is another, often forgotten, aspect of both power and focus. Proper breathing during forms allows one to channel more energy behind their strikes as well as focus their attention on the one hit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">Precision of technique occurs in the practitioner through repetition. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">The more repetition, the more precise the movements become. Likewise the muscle memory gained through practicing forms allows for techniques to become more natural and automatic. So that when needed, the body has no problem executing the technique. It becomes much more likely that you will be able to use the moves with a split seconds warning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">Though many of these skills are often taught verbally, like most aspects of martial arts, you have to practice to make the art your own. Practicing forms is important because it gives the artist time to work through their martial art and learn new things along the way. Forms preserve history and teach us lessons long past, learned from those that came before us. The next time you practice your form, ask yourself: am I just going through the motions, or am I really getting all that I can from this form?</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The world of modern martial arts is full of commercialized schools with watered down training. In an attempt to please the masses, martial arts has become what people want it to be and drifted away from what it was. The following is a list of common Lost Qualities of Modern Martial Arts. Some of these are either severely lacking or missing entirely.<br />
</span></span></p>
<h2>Lost Qualities of Modern Martial Arts</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>The art of manipulation</b></span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8293 " src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24104105/aikido69-300x201.jpg" alt="Throwing your opponent" width="249" height="167" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24104105/aikido69-300x201.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24104105/aikido69-768x516.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24104105/aikido69-400x269.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24104105/aikido69-600x403.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24104105/aikido69.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px" /></b></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The ability to make your opponent do exactly what it is that you want them to. This may mean causing them to react to something that you throw and then exploiting their reaction. Or using their previous attack to your advantage by controlling it and guiding it into your next attack. Manipulation also involves the use of feints and other misleading maneuvers that end in a desired response.</span></span></li>
<li>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>The art of timing</b></span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Timing is an essential martial art skill, and most learn it through trial and error. The problem with this approach is that it takes a very long time for the practitioner to be able to execute proper timing and even longer to understand what they are doing. Timing training can and should be supplemented with drills that specifically target the skill. </span></span></li>
<li>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Ducking, bobbing, and weaving</b></span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Too often do we choose to rely exclusively on the blocks that our art has taught us, while completely ignoring the fact that we don’t actually need to even make contact with the attack. Not only does this eliminate the blow, but we are also able to keep both of our hands up and ready to attack at will.</span></span></li>
<li>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Development of senses</b></span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">This quality refers to both improving our natural senses and becoming more aware of our surroundings. Improved senses naturally increase our situational awareness and both lend themselves to increasing our personal safety. Allowing us to be able to effectively use our martial art skill. </span></span></li>
<li>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Conditioning</b></span></span></h2>
<figure id="attachment_7427" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7427" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-7427 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/24103543/ving-tsun-wing-chun-history-300x216.jpg" alt="Kung Fu Training" width="300" height="216"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-7427" class="wp-caption-text">Shaolin Conditioning</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Though highly prized by some schools, many others choose to ignore the benefits of conditioning. The body should be able to withstand a good degree of abuse in order to have the confidence to be an effective fighter. Odds are that you will get hit, what counts is that you are able to come back from that hit and power through – causing more damage to your opponent. </span></span></li>
<li>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Developing intent over instinct</b></span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Many fighters prove to be either overly intentional in their movements or overly instinctual. A good martial artist will develop a fighting style that balances these two traits, and develops the muscle memory required to execute it. To a point where they are strategic, yet also reactive with good instincts. </span></span></li>
<li>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Proper breath control</b></span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Developing appropriate breathing supports each and every martial art technique. Allowing for more focused and powerful strikes. As well as better cardiovascular function and endurance during a match.</span></span></li>
<li>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Familiarity of pressure points</b></span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">When all else fails, it is always nice to know how to exploit pressure points. Often times it is the more muscular men that are more susceptible to this exploitation, due to the greater surface area and nerve endings the muscles bring. </span></span></li>
<li>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Simultaneous blocking and attacking</b></span></span></h2>
<figure id="attachment_8536" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8536" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-8536 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104258/Wing-Chun-Lakeland-Florida-Kung-Fu-Deep-Patel-training-classes-300x216.jpg" alt="my lakeland wing chun journey deep patel florida" width="300" height="216"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8536" class="wp-caption-text">Tan Sao Punch</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Many martial arts will focus on blocking an attack, and then following that block with a strike. Instead of choosing to defend and attack at the same time. They get stuck on their traditional blocks while the opposite hand just idly sits and waits.</span></span></li>
<li>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Development of character and personal strength</b></span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Finally, martial arts is not in its’ entirety about fighting. A true martial artist aspires to better themselves in every area of their life, from their character to their physical fitness. They choose to respect themselves and others, and strive to pass on the great knowledge that the martial arts has taught them. </span></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">All martial arts were designed during times of strife in order to combat the ugliest parts of humanity. You must keep these in mind during training to ensure the original intentions of these arts are not forgotten. Does your school incorporate all, some, or none of these qualities? </span></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Kicking is hands down one of my favorite things to do. It’s just so versatile. Once you learn how to use your legs, a whole new world of possibilities opens up. And it is a beautiful world. But this world is full of complexities and a ridiculous amount of different kicks. Not to mention the fact that almost every martial art will perform each kick slightly differently. These two facts combine to make learning kicks more difficult than it needs to be, but we are here to help clear some of that confusion. The Kickers Guide A-H (Part I) is a nearly comprehensive list of kicks known to the martial arts world:</span></p>
<h1>The Kickers Guide A-H (Part I)</h1>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Axe Kick</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">An axe kick is usually preformed either to someone already on the ground or to the collarbone/sternum of a standing opponent. Use a straight leg to come in a downward motion striking with the heel. The two biggest variances are in the load of the kick: some people perform axe kicks by swinging a straight leg up into the air and back down again, while others bring their knee to their chest, kick up, and then drive down. The first is easier to perform and more common. The second offers a more controlled technique and is better for attacking a standing opponent.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Back Kick </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Also known as a donkey kick, this kick attacks an opponent that is directly behind you. This kick is more commonly used in fights where there are multiple opponents, as for a general rule you would not want to turn your back on an opponent. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Butterfly Kick</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">This kick is often more for demonstration than practical self defense. It comes from either standing, or a running step in. The body twists as both legs come off the ground, one after the other, with the entire body more or less parallel to the ground. Striking occurs with the heel coming down on the opponent. A very beautiful kick.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Fish Kick </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">A flick like kick done with pointed toes, typically aimed at the groin. The kick comes up in a snapping motion, with the strike occurring somewhat like the flick of a fish’s tail. This kick also targets the head during fighting combinations that end with the opponent being pulled down to knee height.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Front Kick (Push/Snap)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">A front kick refers to either an upward snapping motion (striking under the chin), or a forward thrusting motion (pushing with the ball of the foot). Either way, the kick comes in a direct line in front of the body, usually with the hips squared. This kick is often used to push opponents away, or as an entry move to a follow up technique.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Half-Moon/Crescent (Reverse Half-Moon/Crescent)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">This kick starts with the knee brought up and into the chest. The foot is then thrust out and around, from the outside of the body in. The reverse kick comes from the inside out. This kick is primarily used as an entry move to get past an opponent’s guard, but can also strike to the side of the face or body.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Half Crescent/Tong Kick</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">A forward thrusting kick done with the foot and knee tilted at a 45° angle to the outside of the centerline. Directed toward the knees, hip, or ribs. The Tong kick is similar to the Half Crescent Kick, except the foot and knee are tilted at a 45° angle to the inside of the centerline. This can be aimed at the diaphragm or chin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">These kicks and more make up the bottom half of our martial art strikes, keep an eye out for our next article on the second half of these kicks!</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Punches Across the Arts: When a Karate guy says punch, and a Wing Chun guy says punch, they don’t always mean the same thing.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/punches-across-the-arts/">Punches Across the Arts</a> appeared first on <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com">Sifu Och Wing Chun</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The punch is a staple in every conceivable martial art. Even those that focus on ground work, like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, at least address how to defend against a punch. In short, martial artists like to punch. But when a Karate guy says punch, and a Wing Chun guy says punch, they don’t always mean the same thing. Punches across the arts vary widely and each art has its own reasoning for choosing to punch slightly differently.</p>
<h2>Karate &amp; Tae Kwon Do</h2>
<p>When it comes to Karate and Tae Kwon Do, the punch is exactly the same. As a martial artist holding an instructor level in Karate, I figured that I would not have to research the Karate punch and moved straight into Tae Kwon Do. The very first video I found on Tae Kwon Do punching sounded like I could have made it myself and called it “The Karate Punch.” This punch primarily hits with the first two knuckles closest to the thumb. If you make a fist, you should be able to draw a line from those two knuckles straight up your arm, matching the bones in the forearm. In traditional drills practitioners will chamber at the waist or hip and strike out as the other arm draws back with equal force. However, in sparring or other applications, the punch will usually come from somewhere near the face. Practitioners use this punch because it allows for the structure of the arm to back up the power of the punch.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-8779 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/24104439/karate-235x300.jpg" alt="" width="235" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/24104439/karate-235x300.jpg 235w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/24104439/karate.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>WIng CHun</h2>
<p>In Wing Chun Kung Fu, the punch looks a little different. Instead of a fist with fingers down parallel to the floor, the Wing Chun punch ranges between a 45 degree angle to perpendicular to the ground (depending on the school); with the pointer finger at the crest of the angle and the pinky at the bottom. These punches come through the centerline of a practitioner’s body, attacking with a square chest. The punch strikes from a state of relaxation to tension. It is less forceful than the Karate or TKD punch, but can deliver the same power. Practitioners use this punch for a couple of reasons. This punch is “invisible” because it is often more difficult to see coming. By simply taking the shortest and most direct route to its destination. It also requires the opponent to be closer, being more effective for close quarter contact.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-7586 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/24103633/whipping-punch-300x200.jpg" alt="whipping punch broken down" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/24103633/whipping-punch-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/24103633/whipping-punch-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/24103633/whipping-punch-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/24103633/whipping-punch-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/24103633/whipping-punch.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<figure id="attachment_1383" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1383" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-1383 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/24101329/sifu-och-wing-chun-florida-schools-300x168.jpg" alt="contact-sifu-och-wing-chun-florida-schools" width="300" height="168" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/24101329/sifu-och-wing-chun-florida-schools-300x168.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/24101329/sifu-och-wing-chun-florida-schools.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1383" class="wp-caption-text">Sifu Och&#8217;s Wing Chun Florida School</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Variations</h2>
<p>These two different variations of the punch represent either end of the spectrum. Karate and TKD on one side with Wing Chun Kung Fu on the other. Most other martial arts will fall somewhere in the middle of these punches. Tai Chi punching incorporates the relaxation to tense aspect associated with Wing Chun to the horizontal aspect of Karate/TKD. Whereas in Aikido, they do not focus as much on the techniques of the punch, rather using it as supplementary to other techniques. Muay Thai, Boxing, and Mixed Martial Arts, all utilize a punch called the jab. That is very similar to the Karate/TKD punch, but originates from a guard up by the temples and is more often used as an opening technique.</p>
<h2>Similarities</h2>
<p>Though each martial art may punch a little differently, there are a few concepts that are generally constant. One being to engage the core. Punches may be executed by the arm, but they come from the whole body. Likewise most martial arts will encourage putting hip torque behind punches to make them more effective and powerful. As well as a strong base through structure and rooting. Even though these fine points may be difficult to visibly discern, they are what makes any punch a good punch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ability to close the distance with an opponent is essential to any Wing Chun practitioner. You must be able to quickly respond to an opponents attack and shut them down to avoid follow up attacks. Different ranges call for different responses. That being said we will cover a few Wing Chun Entry Techniques here in this article. Before reading this article we suggesting checking out our previous article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/wing-chun-vs-jab-cross-hook-takedown/">Wing Chun Vs Jab, Cross, Hook Takedown Combo. </a>We explain the difference between committed and non-committed strikes which is essential to your training.</p>
<h2>Hand Entries</h2>
<h3>Paak Slip</h3>
<p>In our previous article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/wing-chun-vs-jab-cross-hook-takedown/">Wing Chun Vs Jab, Cross, Hook Takedown Combo</a> we touch on the idea of using the Paak to simply slip off the first punch. Connected is a video of Master Sifu demonstrating this technique. He explains how to utilize the Paak to deflect the initial blow and then glide off into a strike. A very effective and quick technique.</p>
<h3>Paak Punch</h3>
<p>The Paak Punch is a very effective combo to use. Instead of trading blow for blow with an opponent, the Paak Punch allows you to strike and defend at the same time. When countering a cross or straight punch this is a definite must. You are able to either crush a punch and counter above it with a punch of your own. Or, you can slip the punch and strike the ribs. Either way you are able to immediately counter straight punches and close the distance.</p>
<h3>Paak into Bui or Tan</h3>
<p>If an opponent does not throw a committed strike it can be very difficult to throw a counter. In this case it would be prudent to defect the first punch with a Paak and then counter the second punch. Two great choices would be either a Tan Punch or Bui Sao Punch.</p>
<p>A Tan Punch would be a great choice against any sort of straight punch. Since the Paak would have simply deflected the first punch you can use this as a set up for the second punch counter.</p>
<p>If he throws a haymaker or wide hook the Bui Sao Punch would be the best choice. The curved shape of the Bui Sao would match the trajectory of the hook allowing for maximum protection.</p>
<h2>Kick Entries</h2>
<h3>Shadow Kick</h3>
<p>If facing an opponent that moves a lot, pushing off the front foot, a Shadow Kick may be a option to consider. Our article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/kung-fu-kicks/">Kung Fu Kicks</a> goes into more detail about this kick. The idea is to crush into your opponents leg with a stomping motion. Typically aimed to blow out the knee the lead hand will typically drop as a result opening up an nice window for an attack.</p>
<h3>Crescent Kick</h3>
<p>Finally, the Crescent Kick. One of the most effective ways to use this kick is to the ribs when they extend their punch. This has the same shape as the Shadow Kick but instead of going down it strikes forward. You must thrust your entire body behind the kick. When this is done the head usually comes down as a result of the body caving into the kick. This allows for an easy strike to the head.</p>
<h2>The Key to Closing the Gab</h2>
<p>All of these techniques are futile if you do not close the distance with the right timing. You can only develop timing with hours of practice. Doing techniques in lines are a great way to build the structure for them and speed. However, if you do not consistently keep up your training your timing will be off an no amount of skill will help you if you do not time it correctly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a female martial artist of over a decade, I’ve noticed that women are generally treated differently than their male counterparts. This shouldn’t be a surprising statement and isn’t always a bad thing. Our bodies are structurally different, and those differences should be considered in certain situations. But not all, and certainly not most where martial arts is concerned. In this article,&nbsp;Women in Martial Arts, we will go over some of these considerations.</p>
<h2>When Gender Matters in Martial Arts</h2>
<p>Usually I tend to err towards equality in all situations, especially when it comes to training. But there are a few notable differences that should be addressed when a woman is training in the martial arts.</p>
<p>First off, the way that certain moves are performed may need to be adjusted – depending on the woman. For instance, many schools perform drills that require the non-punching hand to pull back with as much force as the punching hand. This sometimes results in the woman hitting her own breasts as hard as the object she is punching. Which may cause some women to have major problems performing the pull back of a punch due to breast size. On another related topic, breasts are unfortunately a very wide target area while sparring. Though most people at least try and avoid that area, there are always the unintended (or otherwise) slip-ups. Thankfully this can be easily rectified through the use of chest gear.</p>
<p>Another prudent difference is in the necessity of rape defense. Though male rape victims do exist, women are ten times more likely to be raped. This makes learning rape defense a good idea for anybody, but a necessity for women. This includes both wall defense and ground. Learning to escape from being pinned to the wall, or mounted from the ground. As well as education on warning signs and situational awareness.</p>
<h2>When it Shouldn’t</h2>
<p>While we have established that there are in fact scenarios where women should be treated differently, the vast majority of the time that is not the case. Too frequently are women partnered with men who “go easy on them,” thinking that they are doing the woman a favor. But what so many people don’t realize, is that every time a man “goes easy” or throws light punches, a woman doesn’t get to train. If women are only given the opportunity to train against easy punches, they will never be able to defend themselves.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7431" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/24103547/contact-us-sifu-och-wing-chun.jpg" alt="contact us, sifu och contact, contact sifu och" width="240" height="344" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/24103547/contact-us-sifu-och-wing-chun.jpg 240w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/24103547/contact-us-sifu-och-wing-chun-209x300.jpg 209w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></p>
<p>And there is also the consequence of having an inflated and unfounded sense of security. I once believed that I was an excellent grappler, because I was always able to defend myself against the guys I fought. I didn’t find out until later when some guy swept the floor with me, that they had been babying me the whole time. When I went back and talked to those same guys, and they were incredulous saying, “of course we went easy on you.” Which is all well and good until the day that I actually need to defend myself.</p>
<h2>My Perspective</h2>
<p>Being a woman in the martial arts, however, also has its advantages. Women tend to be more flexible, making them less prone to injury due to overextension or pulled muscles. In addition, their wider set hips allow for more mobility as far as performing kicks is concerned.</p>
<p>Martial arts throughout the years has evolved and changed to meet the needs of each generation. Although martial arts may be primarily a male dominant activity, women still make up a large percentage of its participants. In fact, Wing Chun was actually created by a woman. While she may have faced different struggles in the 17<sup>th</sup> century, we are all just looking to be able to defend ourselves.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>But weightlifting goes beyond additional speed and power, affecting our bodies down to bone. Other studies show that lifting can improve bone density.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">It should come as no surprise that cardio and weightlifting can both greatly improve your abilities as a martial artist. People have been using cardio and weightlifting to supplement their martial arts for as long as martial arts itself. The health benefits they provide are beneficial to every aspect of life, but what do they do specifically for the martial artist?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>Cardiovascular Exercise</b></span></h2>
<h3>Treadmill vs Sparring</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Doing any martial art will include a good amount of cardiovascular exercise. In fact, one study showed that performing martial art kata’s and engaging in sparring increased heart rate to a higher level than that of running on a treadmill (Iide et al., 2008). This is mostly due to the fact that kata’s and sparring engage the upper body in more dynamic movements than running does. That’s not to say that running on a treadmill doesn’t add its own benefits to martial arts, because it does. The cardio performed while practicing martial arts is usually in short bursts, ranging from less than a minute to about three minutes on average. And while this (quasi-interval training) has its own benefits, the endurance gained from long distance running takes martial artists to the next level. It allows them to excel during prolonged testing periods and back-to-back sparring matches.</span></p>

<h3>Recovery</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Martial arts instructors are particularly known for pushing student’s bodies to the limit in class. They want not only for you to build muscle, but also to have the ability to keep pushing even when your body wants to quit. Cardiovascular exercise after a workout can help remove some of the toxins built up in your bloodstream during that workout. Effectively reducing the muscle soreness sure to come in the days to follow (Clark, 2015). And for no other reason, if you do need to use your training in a real street scenario you have no idea hard long you will need to engage your enemy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>Weightlifting </b></span></h2>
<h3>Adding Power</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">There have been countless studies done on the benefits of weightlifting, however, very few in regards to martial arts. One such study found that weightlifting has the ability to “increase punching and kicking speed, or power” (Iide et al., 2008). This same study suggests adding in twisting crunches to increase torque power behind the hip rotations so common in martial arts. Has an instructor ever told you to put more hip behind your strike? In addition, incorporating cleans and snatches could help in generating more explosive leg power for kicks and structure. </span></p>
<h3>Strength Down to the Bone</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">But weightlifting goes beyond additional speed and power, affecting our bodies down to bone. Other studies show that lifting can improve bone density. “Not only can weigh training increase bone density, it can improve muscle mass, balance and connective tissue strength” (Seltzer, 2013). With all of these factors combined, the risk of injury in martial arts is greatly reduced. Think about all the times that you have been hit or thrown to the ground. Improved balance and connective tissue strength could make the difference between a fall and a serious injury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Adding cardio and weightlifting will provide numerous benefits not only to your martial arts training, but also to your overall health. And if you are looking to combine cardio, weightlifting, and martial arts, consider making our kickboxing classes a part of your training regimen. Sifu Och personally explains some of our training in his article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/muscle-conditioning-kung-fu/">&#8220;Muscle Conditioning With Kung Fu&#8221;</a>.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sparring has many faces across the martial arts and is even used for different purposes. But you would be hard pressed to find a martial art that doesn’t include it in some form. That form can be one of many things: (standing, ground, light contact, point, continuous, ect.). Even so, we will focus on entry sparring moves from a traditional standing match. Entry sparring moves include all techniques that make the opponent more open or vulnerable to follow up techniques. These almost always preformed in a sequence of moves instead of a single strike. The following are some of the most used as well as some personal favorites from our kwoon.</p>
<h2>Entry Sparring Moves</h2>
<h3><b>Jab and Cross</b></h3>
<p>The jab and cross combo is one of the most basic and widely used sparring techniques. It is simple and effective against an untrained opponent. And even some of the more thoroughly trained ones. The jab cross is simply two consecutive punches, aimed toward either the same or different locations. One is off of the front leg and the second off the back with a little more added torque. The idea is that the jab cross happens so fast that the opponent has a difficult time blocking both the first and second attacks. Ideally if the first punch doesn’t make it, the second one will.</p>
<h3><b>Low Kick, High Strike</b></h3>
<p>Another great entry move involves performing a low kick, and following it up with a strike to the head or upper body. The low kick will often cause the opponent to drop their hands in order to protect their lower body, opening them up for a higher strike. Even if the opponent doesn’t wind up dropping their hands, they are often at least slightly distracted by the kick – allowing for your follow-ups to have a better chance.</p>
<h3><b>Fakes</b></h3>
<p>Faking attacks has the potential to distract, like a low kick or jab, only without as much risk of failure. Oftentimes people will go to block “fake” attacks that never would have hit them. This allows for the attacker to predict where the opponent’s hands will be after the fake in order to best follow up. Usually the fake will cause the opponents hands to drop or move away from their body, something that can be predicted and exploited if done correctly.</p>
<h3><b>Huen Sao &amp; Faak Sao</b></h3>
<p>The Huen Sao and Faak Sao are specific to Wing Chun, although other arts may have their own versions of the moves. A huen sao is the circling of a hand with the intention to move around an opponent’s arm, much like a snake would slither around a tree branch. Once you use this move to get around the arm, the opponent is open for rib and upper body strikes. The Faak Sao uses a forward chopping motion in which the arm and hand are horizontal. It is typically used to either intercept a high attack or to attack an opponent’s head. When used to intercept a punch, it can clear the way for a second attack.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8589" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104330/growth-in-wing-chun-lakeland-florida-sifu-och.jpg" alt="Growth in Wing Chun Kung Fu lakeland Fl" width="300" height="216"></p>
<h2>Just one more</h2>
<p>A lot of times in sparring you have to assume that the first attack you throw is not going to make target; that is essentially the reason that combos exist. But even though we assume it may not hit, that doesn’t mean that we treat it like it won’t. And because these are some of the more common sparring moves, make sure that you aren’t falling for them. Or better yet, make yourself learn equally great counter moves to all of these entry attacks. Even just adding any one of the above techniques to your repertoire of sparring moves would make a great asset. But why stop at one?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Wing Chun vs Jab, Cross, Hook, Takedown</h1>
<p>Wing Chun vs Jab, Cross, Hook, Takedown was a question a beginner posted for anyone to answer on a Facebook group. He asked for the key to using&nbsp;Wing Chun vs Jab, Cross, Hook, Takedown Combo. Sifu Justin Och and Senior Instructor Garret Brumfield posted a video titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bfI2MOn_oI">&#8220;Wing Chun vs Jab, Cross, Hook, Takedown Combo&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7bfI2MOn_oI" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>In this article we will address some of the finer points. Stopping&nbsp;this combo is no easy task but Wing Chun does have an answer.</p>
<h2>Wing Chun vs Jab, Cross, Hook, Takedown Combo</h2>
<h3>The Jab</h3>
<p>If you are to deal with an attack you must understand it. To understand strikes you must make a distinction between committed and non-committed strikes. A committed strike could be defined as a strike that has the entire weight of the body fueling the power for the strike. Alternatively, a non-committed strike will be much faster but won&#8217;t have the power. A jab is a non committed strike. That being the case, the counter must be equally fast. As you can see in the video Sifu Och uses his paak sao but immediately follows up with a straight punch. This allows for quick adjustments where needed.</p>
<h3>The Jab, Cross</h3>
<p>If your opponent crosses immediately after his jab you may not have time to follow up off the initial strike. Sifu chose is one of the most direct options to counter although there are many variations. The hand that was used to paak the initial strike simply follows its trajectory to the face. In conjunction, the back hand paaks the next strike. This results in and immediate strike to your opponents face.</p>
<h3>The Jab, Cross, Hook</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s say that your counter does not damage your opponent enough. As a result, he follows up again with a hook. The hook that Sifu Och Demonstrates is a very tight &#8220;rabbit&#8221; hook. Theses types of hooks are very hard to deal with. A Bui Sao, Bui Jee, Man Sao will be very hard to execute in this scenario. You must be able to fully extend these techniques for them to become effective. When the opponent throws this hook, it will be very tight to the body with a lot of torque. Torque equals power, and if you are unable to fully extend your technique it will crumble. In this scenario Sifu chooses to utilize upward elbow to cover the opponents strike. He is now able to strike with is other hand and move on with his attack.</p>
<h3>The Jab, Cross, Hook, Takedown</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8389 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104117/17693117_10211973694912812_345342688_o-225x300.jpg" alt="wing chun vs jab cross hook" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104117/17693117_10211973694912812_345342688_o-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104117/17693117_10211973694912812_345342688_o-400x533.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104117/17693117_10211973694912812_345342688_o-768x1025.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104117/17693117_10211973694912812_345342688_o-450x600.jpg 450w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104117/17693117_10211973694912812_345342688_o.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></p>
<p>Finally, we moved on to dealing last part of the&nbsp;combo. None of your counters have successfully stopped your opponent but because you are in so tight he feels the need to shoot in and take you down.&nbsp;There are two scenarios to be address when an opponent shoots in on you. If he gets under your elbow or not.</p>
<p>If he does not get under your able a you can simple remove the foot he is attacking and stop his forward motion with a Gum or Jum Sao to the neck\head.&nbsp;This is addressed in our article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/fighting-footwork/">Fighting Footwork</a>&nbsp;where we go into a little more depth. However, if he does get behind one of your elbows you must sprawl back or you will be taken down. Once you have sprawled you can then establish a line of defense again with your Jum or Gum Sao. This line allows you to regain your structure and move on with your attack.</p>
<h2>End the fight</h2>
<p>At each stage of the attack your goal as a Wing Chun practitioner should be to the end the fight. When you respond to an attack you should be immediately seeking to follow it up to finish your opponent.&nbsp;You would only utilized these counter techniques if you are unable to flow into and 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc. follow up. So in theory, your opponent will never get to his takedown, or his cross for that matter. However, that is why we as martial artists should always be prepared. If the worst happens, you will be ready.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many kicks used in a fight. Some more useful than others. In this article, Kung Fu Kicks, we will show some of the kicks used at Sifu Och Wing Chun. We will review the Inside and Outside Shadow Kicks, Tong Kick, Half Crescent, and Side Kick.</p>
<h2>Wing Chun Kicks</h2>
<p>Before going into the the specific kicks let us touch on Wing Chun as a system to set the groundwork. In short, Wing Chun&#8217;s goal is to end the fight as quickly as possible. Every strike intent on crushing the opponent. Understanding that goal the kicks that we choose to utilize fall into the place.</p>
<h3>Inside Shadow Kick</h3>
<p>One of the most useful kicks to use is the Inside Shadow Kick. Kicking the opponent in the knee is one of the quickest ways to end the fight. With this Shadow Kick, considerable force can be driven through a target at a downward angle. The setup (implied in the name) is that the kick is done in the shadow of your hands. As a result, an opponent will find it difficult to avoid or stop this type of kick. The reason is because it is usually done in unison with the hands. Not only can it be used to attack it can be used in defense as well. It can be used to stop low kicks to the leg.</p>

<h3>Outside Shadow Kick</h3>
<p>Equally important, not all enemies or targets will be directly in front of you. The Outside Shadow Kick allows you to hit targets off center. They can also be used to block kicks depending on the angle. Furthermore, one advantage of this kick in particular is it can be used to drive out the support leg of an opponents kick. Jum Saos together with a low shadow kick can block roundhouses and blast the supporting leg.</p>

<h3>Tong Kick</h3>
<p>The Tong kick is similar to a front kick. Uniquely, however, it&nbsp;thrusts in upward diagonal angle. Can be used for multiple targets, but it&#8217;s primary hit is the Xiphoid. Combined with a Double Jum Sao, this is a great choice to counter a roundhouse. In addition, it can be used used to strike the ribs or inside of the thigh.</p>

<h3>Half Crescent Kick</h3>
<p>The Half Crescent Kick similarly takes the same shape as the Inside Shadow Kick. The difference is it drives forward as opposed to down. This kick is usually delivered to the ribs when a punch is thrown. Countering a Jab or Cross style punch with a Crescent Kick is a great option. It is unexpected which it was lends to it&#8217;s usefulness.</p>

<h3>Side Kick</h3>
<p>Overall, the Side Kick is one of Wing Chun&#8217;s longest ranged weapons. One of it&#8217;s main uses is delivering a powerful strike to the side when turning to face the opponent may not be available. Whether it&#8217;s a question of speed or restriction doesn&#8217;t matter. The side kick allows an immediate response to someone coming from the side. It can be done two different ways:</p>
<p>Static, fired directly from your stance:</p>

<p>or with a skip. The skip allows for a the distance and power to be increased by swinging the back foot foot. The base is re-established closer to the target and momentum is gained which increases the power.</p>

<h2>The key to your Kicks</h2>
<p>One thing all of these kicks have in common is what part of the foot is going to be used to strike the body. If you read our article &#8220;Fighting Footwork&#8221; you will see how the body needs to be aligned through the heel for structure. With the correct structure your power drives from your legs through your heels for maximum damage. This is similar to a person doing a heavy squat. Moreover, to support the weight the heel must be used. Piggybacking off of that concept is another, focused energy. If you take the energy you would use to slap someone and applied it to a needle, you will easily penetrate the skin. Just the same with your kick, if you drive all your power through your heel your damage is focused through that one point as opposed to spread through whole foot.</p>
<p>In conclusion, focus your power and train your structure and you will be able to develop kicks that will drop any opponent you face.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can have the fastest hands in the world, but if you aren&#8217;t at the right place at the right time that won&#8217;t matter. Foot work is literally the foundation to any style. You may be able to block or evade an attack here and there with good hands or head movement. However, if you do not base your counter with fighting footwork, it will be difficult to execute.</p>
<h2>positioning your Fighting footwork</h2>
<p>Superior angles will make your life much easier. It is much simpler to deal with an opponent when you have minimized their ability to use multiple &#8220;weapons&#8221; at once. In the same way, striking your opponents key points will also be easier when you are positioned correctly. Wing Chun seeks to dominate the outside angle allowing maximum trapping and striking to occur.</p>
<h2>Weight distribution</h2>
<p>There is a big debate among Wing Chun practitioners. Not only about weight distribution through the feet but also between the legs. First let&#8217;s address weight through the feet.</p>
<h3>Heels</h3>
<p>When a weight lifter squats his weight must drive from the middle portion of his foot to his heels. With proper skeletal alignment his structure is locked in place and only the strongest muscles are recruited to move the weight. If alignment is broken serious injury can occur. When finished correctly the weight will be completely on the heels as seen here. <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8359" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104112/squat-form.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="347" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104112/squat-form.jpg 604w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104112/squat-form-400x230.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104112/squat-form-600x345.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104112/squat-form-300x172.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" /></p>
<p>Just as the weight lifting supports his weight with structure, the Wing Chun Fighter supports his power through his alignment. Following the same rules through physiques the weight is on the heel when engaged. This allows strikes at full power to be stopped and maximum strength can be delivered through blows.</p>
<h3>Toes</h3>
<p>Even though the heels are the source of power and structure, speed is seriously inhibited when the weight is focused there. Weight should only be distributed to the toes when looking to utilize speed. Speed is used to gain the correct position. This is typically done before contact is even made. Once connected to your opponent weight should immediately be transferred to the heels to again for power. Closing the distance with an opponent is essential to the Wing Chun Fighter. If he is unable to get to the trapping range it will be difficult to execute proper techniques.</p>
<h2>Stance Distribution</h2>
<p>The final aspect of weight distribution to cover is the amount of weight on each foot.&nbsp; At Sifu Och Wing Chun we typically keep our weight 50-50. The reason behind this is to keep our ability to defend against takedowns. If the weight is distributed to far to one leg you can become susceptible to those types of attacks. Sweeps and single leg takedowns are difficult to stop without even distribution of weight.</p>
<p>To give a specific example, we will look at a single leg takedown&nbsp;defense. First, hand positions: jum to the neck, gan to the arm. (Essentially a Gan Da). This will then become a tan and a fook. The Jum to the neck stops the person from getting to your core. The gan to the arm is used to block them from getting your leg. As a result you gain&nbsp;an underhook. (illustrated below).</p>

<p>In unison the foot that is being attacked must be retracted. The foot must be swept back to avoid getting caught. This all occurs within a split second. If the weight split 70-30, or 60-40, it will be very hard to adjust and defend this type of attack.</p>
<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are many different opinions and reasons about weight distribution. At Sifu Och Wing Chun we keep it mostly 50-50 to maintain the ability to adjust in any direction as quickly as possible. We are then able to shift and adapt to any attack that is thrown our way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first few months of a martial artist are crucial to their success. Instructors must work to instill confidence from day one. The student must learn to trust not only their instructors but also the techniques they are learning. If a student knows what he is learning is practical and useful from the start he will stick around for the fine tuning of those techniques. At Sifu Och Wing Chun we want to help students learn a basic Wing Chun Defense right from the beginning. To help cover some of the most basic attacks we teach 3 defenses right away: Bui Sao, Tan Sao, and Gan Sao.</p>
<h2>Bui Sao</h2>
<p>Haymakers (wide hooks) are some of the most common attacks you will see on the street. Without training the body&#8217;s natural tendency to draw power will be to twist. This results in a chain and ball effect on the arm with the punch being the ball of course. While these can still do damage they can be easily defended with proper training. That is why one of the first techniques we teach to new students is the Bui Sao. The deflecting hand is shaped as if you were blocking light from the sun. Palm facing away from the body pressing from the elbow. The palm will be about forehead height and the elbow in line with the trachea. This provides a wall of cover with the forearm.</p>

<h2>Tan Sao</h2>
<p>One of the more famous moves in Wing Chun is the Tan Sao. When teaching it to children we call it the &#8220;pizza hand&#8221;. This is due to the palm facing upward with the arm extended outward. The Tan Sao is used primarily against straight punches. It deflects punches off the centerline either to the inside or the outside opening up your opponent for a variety of follow ups. You can view a video of the Tan Saos on our Instagram by clicking here&gt;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BSwDUN7DtHd/?taken-by=sifuochwingchun">Tan Saos</a>.</p>

<h2>Gan sao</h2>
<p>Used against nasty body shots or uppercuts is the Gan Sao. Translated it means &#8220;low plowing hand&#8221;, this technique is very effective for defending the lower half of the body. To shape your Gan Sao simply reach your hand out in front of you as if you were shaking hands with someone. Your hand should end up in front of your belly button and your elbow about a fists distance off of your rib cage. This allows your ribs to be covered and consequently, your hand is now fairly close to your opponents body. You are now prepared for an easily follow up such as a palm to the ribs or an uppercut to the face.</p>

<h2>Basic Wing Chun Defense Striking</h2>
<p>All three of these defenses have something in common; they are paired with a straight punch. As opposed to many other styles most defenses in Wing Chun are combined with some sort of attack. In this case it is the straight punch. There are other variations off of these basics but for beginners we use the punch to begin with. The straight punch is delivered with the fist held vertically at a 45 degree angle. The reason for this is mainly structure. There is also a nice perk associated with it; it fits nicely under the chin to strike the side of the neck. As a result you can easily deliver a crippling blow to an opponent by simply changing the angle of your fist.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To Summarize, the Bui Sao, Tan Sao, and Gan Sao are three effective and important attacks you must know for your self defense. They allow you attack and defend simultaneously. These are so useful that they were borrowed by many Krav Schools to be incorporated into their system as well. Train these hard and you will have a good starting point.</p>

Why would I do it if it weren’t?” But the honest truth is that a lot of martial artists are not equipped to defend themselves in a real world scenario. So where is the disconnect between Kwoon Self Defense and the Real World ? Why are so many people practicing ineffectual martial arts? And what does a truly effective martial art look like? </span></div>
<h2 class="_d97"><span class="_5yl5">The Disconnect in Kwoon Self Defense and the Real World<br />
</span></h2>
<div class="_d97"><span class="_5yl5">When people try and understand why the martial arts have drifted away from effective training methods there are a few factors to consider. Primarily the difficulty of taking an individual and training them to be able to defend themselves in any scenario is no easy feat. There is no conceivable way for an individual to practice every possible scenario. So what do we do? We have to train our instincts and expand our knowledge base, to prepare ourselves for any given scenario though we may not have practiced for it. Another problem lies in an instructors innate desire to gain and keep students. Sometimes this desire may lead schools to adapt an easier, less effective curriculum in order to keep students entertained and engaged. When this happens it can be easy to fall into a lull of safety and easy money, perpetuating a sense of accomplishment. </span></div>
<div class="_d97"></div>
<div class="_d97"><span class="_5yl5">The biggest danger comes when the student, having done exceptionally well in class, is now faced with a real world scenario that they are not prepared to deal with. The student enters into this scenario with a false sense of confidence and may end up making things worse. We find another difficulty in lack of experienced instructors. Though the instructor may have plenty of martial arts experience, they are completely inept when it comes to real world fighting experience. And how is someone with no experience expected to give a complete curriculum to their students? This is the main question when comparing Kwoon Self Defense and the Real World.<br />
</span></div>
<h2 class="_d97"><span class="_5yl5">Ineffective vs. Effective Martial Arts</span></h2>
<div class="_d97"><span class="_5yl5"> Let me be clear, no martial art is in and of itself ineffective, the effectiveness lies within how we train that martial art. Drills in the martial arts can be effective tools at making certain techniques ingrained in the student’s mind and muscle memory; however, many drills isolate a certain skill with the intention of honing that skill while we ignore other skills.</span></div>
<div class="_d97"></div>
<div class="_d97">Major problems occur when teachers fail to integrate those isolated skill together. <span class="_5yl5">Take for example point sparring. Many martial arts accept point sparring as a means of being able to practice all of one’s martial skills. But what if the fight goes to the ground? Or the opponent doesn’t back off after you score a point? Point sparring can be an effective training tool, but it is important to accept that it does not simulate a real fight. </span></div>
</div>

<div class="_d97"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6744" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/24102758/lakeland-fl-advanced-martial-arts-classes-sparring1.jpg" alt="lakeland fl advanced martial arts classes sparring" width="340" height="227" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/24102758/lakeland-fl-advanced-martial-arts-classes-sparring1.jpg 340w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/24102758/lakeland-fl-advanced-martial-arts-classes-sparring1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /></div>
<div class="_5w1r _3_om _5wdf">
<div class="_4gx_">
<div class="_d97"></div>
<div class="_d97"><span class="_5yl5">In an effective school of martial arts, there must be a comprehensive curriculum. One that teaches not only good techniques, but also when, where, and how to use them. It is important for a student to be able to deescalate a fight before it starts, and only consider fighting as a last resort. An effective martial art will teach all aspects of self defense: technique, execution, timing, and distancing. They must also teach determination. Students must drill regardless of whether or not they get bored. In modern martial arts there seems to be a dangerous trend of catering to what the student wants. But if we were really doing what was best for the student, wouldn’t it be catering to what they need instead of what they want?<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The idea that Wing Chun has no long range &#8220;game&#8221; has circled the internet for a while. It is true that Wing Chun focuses its techniques on &#8220;in&#8221; fighting but that does not mean it is not effective further away. Wing Chun, although it has longer range techniques, simply prefers to close the distance as soon as possible. This may give the impression that there are no long range techniques to those unfamiliar with the art.</p>
<h2>Wing Chun&#8217;s Goal</h2>
<p>To understand this topic one must remember what the goal of Wing Chun is: to end a fight as quickly as possible. Many people consider Wong Shun Leung to be the greatest fighter to come out of Ip Man&#8217;s training. This can be attributed to his history of Beimo fights. As the story goes he won between 60-80 street fights all in under 3 seconds. With Wing Chun creation at a time of war this makes sense. One needs to end the fight as quickly as possible. That in mind, lets explore the idea of long range fighting versus short range fighting.</p>
<h2>Long Range Fighting Versus Short Range</h2>
<p>There are 3-4 main ranges in martial arts depending on who you are talking to. Striking (Kicking and punching), trapping, and grappling. Each range has it&#8217;s advantages and disadvantages. Striking is the range with boxers and Tae Kwon Do Fighters. Grappling is the home to Judo and Bjj Practitioners. Trapping is found between the two and is where Wing Chun mostly operates. For this discussion we will focus on the Striking range versus the trapping range. Examples of &#8220;Striking&#8221; range attacks would be a boxers jab and cross or a Tae Kwon Do fighters roundhouse and spinning back kick. Examples of a &#8220;trapping&#8221; range attack would be a Paak Punch or Huen Sao strike in Wing Chun.</p>
<p>The main advantage of the Striker is distance. If a striker can successfully fend on an opponent they can never enter into the other ranges nullifying their abilities. Quick foot work combined with deceptive fakes can quite difficult to deal with. Wing Chun seeks to close the distance as quickly as possible. However, if the Wing Chun practitioner cannot do that, it may be difficult to end the fight.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;Wing Chun&#8217;s Answer to the Long Range game</h2>
<p>So then how does a Wing Chun fighter deal with an opponent that will not commit and fully engage at the same range? There are specific techniques that need to be used with certain attacks but before that even happens there must be the strategy. The strategy is baiting. The techniques come from Wing Chun&#8217;s ability to use 2-3 &#8220;weapons&#8221; at the same time.</p>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s look a the strategy first. If the opponent tries to stay &#8220;out of range&#8221; the Wing Chun fighter must draw in the opponent until they through a committed strike. When they throw that strike the counter must be fast and ferocious. Jabs and front kicks are to of the main weapons seen when trying to keep an opponent away. Trying to counter these can be difficult due to their speed. These are best deflected with an equally quick defense. Man sao&#8217;s, Paak Sao&#8217;s, and Jum saos are usually the most effective.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-4193 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24102513/IMG_2746-300x200.jpg" alt="Wing Chun 33801" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24102513/IMG_2746-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24102513/IMG_2746-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24102513/IMG_2746-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24102513/IMG_2746.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h3>Technique</h3>
<p>With the strategy in place the Wing Chun fighter can counter. Again, the emphasis must be place on using multiple weapons at once. When the opponent throws their &#8220;knockout&#8221; strike they must be overwhelmed immediately. If not they will retreat and continue to attempt to break down the Wing Chun Fighter. Against crosses Paak Punches and Intercepting Fist strikes do well.But to prep the counter a shadow kick to the lead thigh slows down the movement of the opposition. If an opponent throws a kick one of the most effective tactics is to kick out the support leg. These can be done simultaneously with a block when used against roundhouses. When a front kick is through it should either be passed off with a jum or it can be caught. Once caught the support can then be accessed for a kick or sweep.</p>

<h2>Wing Chun&#8217;s Weakness is the student</h2>
<p>The idea that Wing Chun has no long range game is not necessarily correct. Rather, Wing Chun seeks to disrupt the core of the fighter which can only be done when close to the opponent. Therefore, the Wing Chun fighter simply closes the distance as quickly as possible. When a ranged attack it should be countered and then followed with and flurry of overwhelming attacks that do not allow for a recovery. Wing Chun as a system as many tools at it&#8217;s disposal, whether they are used correctly is up to who uses them.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>In this article we will review some similarities and differences between Wing Chun and Krav Maga. </p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Krav Maga is renowned for is brutality and viciousness. The Israeli military adopted it because it can be taught in a short amount of time. Wing Chun, made famous by Bruce Lee and the recent &#8220;Ip Man&#8221; movies, is known for its speed and ability to devastate an attacker. In recent years there has been a rise in both across the US. How are the two connected and why the sudden growth in popularity? We will delve into that in this article.</p>
<h2>40&#8217;s-90&#8217;s</h2>
<p>In a post WWII world interaction and fascination with Japan was at it&#8217;s height. Many Japanese now lived in the US. Interaction with the American culture grew and grew. With the interaction came Karate which spread across the US like wild fire. However, as with any trend, there are people that would take advantage of that only for monetary gain. Karate, as a legitimate art, began to become watered down. Even though there existed many good schools (and many still do), the general public started to notice the negative trend. By and large Karate in the US morphed from a powerful, dangerous art, to a weaker cousin that was only suited for tournaments and scoring points. This shift paved the way for something new to take hold.</p>
<p><em>(Writer&#8217;s note: This section of the Article is not a stab at Karate. It is simply pointing out the unfortunate decline of authenticity as a whole in the US.)</em></p>
<h2>&nbsp;Modern Krav Maga Versus Wing Chun</h2>
<p>With Bruce Lee&#8217;s explosion onto the scene, Kung Fu (specifically Wing Chun) started to get some of the limelight. Around the same time Krav Maga started to make it&#8217;s way to the US. With Wing Chun focusing on the most direct route to it&#8217;s target and Krav using a blend of styles to achieve maximum brutality, the stage was set for the two to emerge. However, before we continue with their growth in the U.S. lets look at some differences and similarities between the two.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8309" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24104111/imi01.jpg" alt="" width="282" height="176"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-7559 " src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/24103616/Phoenix-Eye-Fist-300x202.jpg" alt="Learn These Three Moves" width="260" height="175" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/24103616/Phoenix-Eye-Fist-300x202.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/24103616/Phoenix-Eye-Fist-768x517.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/24103616/Phoenix-Eye-Fist-400x270.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/24103616/Phoenix-Eye-Fist-600x404.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/24103616/Phoenix-Eye-Fist.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Similarities </strong></h3>
<p>Both Krav and Wing Chun were designed at a time of war. Wing Chun during the 17th century China at civil war and Krav during the 1930 right after WW1 and prior to WWII. Wing Chun was designed originally to be a system that could be learned in a fraction of the time of the available Kung Fu systems. In the same way, Krav fused boxing, judo, juijistu , and aikido to create something that Jewish civilians could immediately defend themselves with. In recent times Krav has added Maui Thai and actually some Wing Chun (through Jeet Kune Do) into its system. They both seek to dispatch their opponent as quickly as possible. Additionally, both systems &#8220;fight dirty&#8221;, using any means necessary to prevail.</p>
<h3><strong>Differences </strong></h3>
<p>Now even with Wing Chun&#8217;s addition to Krav Maga there will obviously still be differences. First to be addressed would be training time. Modern Wing Chun takes anywhere from 8-10 years to finish the system.* Whereas the entire Krav system can be learned (on a military style training regiment) in four months to a year. Both of these depended on the dedication of the student of course. Second, Wing Chun was designed as a complete system with which all parts fuse together and flow seamlessly. Comparatively, Krav fused many styles so there will naturally be some disconnect systems.</p>
<p>The third difference would be training style. One perk of a Krav School is that they tend to really focus on the brutality of combat. Understanding, right from the beginning, how chaotic combat can be. The right mindset is instilled right from the start and can be seen all throughout their training. Wing Chun on the other hand does utilize more finesse. In training the &#8220;soft&#8221; side the harshness of combat can sometimes be lost in some schools.</p>
<p>In Closing, both systems are effective in street combat. With Karate, and a few other arts, becoming very commercialized, the public wanted something new. Something that gets right to the point and gets the job done. That is the reason for the two arts quick rise to fame. Now with all arts both Krav and Wing Chun have also fallen prey to commercialization. So before choosing a school do your homework on the instructors! Once you choose, train hard and stay committed!</p>
<h3>*(Writers note: Wing Chun in the 17th century was designed to be learned in 3 years. This was accomplished by monks training 8 hours a day consistently.)</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">What is the difference between different Wing Chun Swords within different&nbsp;<a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/different-wing-chun-lineages-expanding-skill/">Wing Chun Lineages</a>? &nbsp;Without reading a ton of books or travelling all over the world, What are some quick differences between lineages and how they use the sword? &nbsp;This is what we are about to answer.</span></span></p>
<p>The principle of the Wing Chun Swords also known as Wing Chun butterfly swords form, eight slashing knives or eight-point-slashing-swords, (<span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>baat Jaam Dao</i></span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">) is akin to that of the hand-to-hand system. The core philosophy is to overcome the opponent with fast, simple, and straightforward strikes. However, there may be differences in how the form is properly performed. Some within the lineages of Wing Chun may have opposing views on certain actions in the form of its entirety creating the different &#8220;Baat Jaam Dao Lineages&#8221;.</span></span></p>
<h2>Wing Chun Swords &#8211; Baat Jaam Dao By Dr. Smith</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> According to Dr. Joseph Smith,to identify an ideal Wing Chun Swords ( butterfly sword ) look at the &#8220;ear&#8221;. Which might also be referred to as the guard or D-guard, of the sword. Similar to that of the </span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>tsumi</i></span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> (wing tip) on a </span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>sai</i></span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> the D-guard of the butterfly sword is curved and not flat. The reason behind this is because not only is the D-guard used for trapping and locking-up weapons it is also used as a means of rotating the blade; one cannot successfully rotate the blade with a flat D-guard as it will catch on your thumb. Allowing rotation of the blade provides one the ability to reinforce their blocking by aligning the blunt top edge with the forearm; it can also be used for slashes and elbow smashes. Additionally, by rotating the swords and aligning them together (handle to handle) one will create a greater blocking area. </span></span></p>

<h2>Wing Chun Swords &#8211; Baat Jaam dao by D. Gibson</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Contradictory to Dr. Smith, Alan Gibson states in his book </span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>Wing Chun: The Works</i></span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">, “…There are no actions that flick the knife into a reverse grip as this is too risky”. This may be true in cases of an actual fight where rotating the swords can mean a matter of life and death. However, in </span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>Baat Jaam Dao</i></span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">, rotation is a routine part of the form. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In his book, Gibson mentioned that there are no stabbing movements with the swords (only slashing, as the name implies). Gibson&#8217;s explaination is if one were to stab another you risk the chances of immobilizing the sword; thus, rendering it useless. It is understandable to consider such a concern, even more so if facing multiple opponents, but the probability of it occurring is low. Despite its name (eight-point-slashing-swords) the form does not exclude any movements or actions that identify with thrusts or stabs. Actually, the first and second of the eight sections in </span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>Baat Jaam Dao</i></span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;( Wing Chun Swords ) requires thrust actions—though some lineages may have the sections ordered differently. </span></span></p>
<h2>Similarities in Wing Chun Swords Lineages</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> Despite several of their performance differences their principle and several methods of </span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>Baat Jaam Dao </i></span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">come together. For instance, unlike the stance for the dragon poles </span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>Luk Dim Boon Kwun </i></span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">where a low “horse stance” (giving a low center of gravity) is needed for balance and to create a power base, the Wing Chun Swords (&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>Baat Jaam Dao )</i></span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> stance is quite opposite. The performed stance in Wing Chun Swords (&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>Baat Jaam Dao )</i></span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> is the small circle triangular footwork, similar to the Wing Chun fighting stance but with a more upright posture and less bending of the knees. This will make the body’s center of gravity higher adding to faster movements. The footwork is altered in that in the form as a way of stepping called </span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>gote ma</i></span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">; using the step. One will be able to turn their body sideways facing the opponent, directing their body off the opponents center-line. Doing so minimizes the chance of being stabbed or cut. In conjunction with courage, timing and speed one will be able to easily narrow the gap between them and opponent; granting access to the opponent’s weapon hand and their bodies vital regions. </span></span></p>
<h2>Grandmaster Yip Man and WSL</h2>
<p><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> As a matter of fact, even one of grandmaster Yip Man’s top students, Wong Shun Leung’s</span></span><i> </i><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">form of </span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>Baat Jaam Dao</i></span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> differs from the son&#8217;s of Yip Man’s form.</span></span> Differences being the importance of certain moves over others and what order they appear in. The bottom line is that though some lineages of Wing Chun may differentiate in their form performances, even training performances for that matter; they still hold the same principle, teaching and reasoning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><!-- @page { margin: 0.79in } P { margin-bottom: 0.08in } --></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: medium;">When broken up, martial is referred to as “those inclined to war or fighting”.&nbsp; Art is referred to as “the expression or</span> <span style="font-size: medium;">creative skill and imagination”. Thus, martial arts is to be translated as “the expression of creative fighting skills”. Some (possibly the majority) of the practices still firmly embrace this concept.&nbsp; However there are other practices that use martial arts as a catalyst and add it with the practices philosophy in order to create a new self. In this part of our two part series titled &#8220;Martial Arts Philosophy-Chinese Versus Japanese Part 1&#8221;, we will cover the Chinese side of the two lines of thinking.<br />
</span></h3>
<div id="TextSection" dir="LTR">
<h3><span style="font-size: medium;">Martial = inclined to war or fighting </span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-size: medium;">Art = expression or creative skill</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martial Arts = Expressive or Creative Skill in Fighting </span></h3>
<h2 style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER"><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Chinese Martial Arts</b></span></span></h2>
</div>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Despite it having a combat effectiveness, Kung Fu (also pronounced Gung Fu) is founded on the philosophy of attaining intelligence and wisdow. Two qualities that take years to develop and attain. Additionally, the first character, Kung, when translated, means “training intensely” or “skillful work”. Translation of the second character, fu, refers to “time spent”. Together, Kung Fu may be translated as “time spent training hard” or “spending time on skillful work”. By this translation it is somewhat difficult to pin kung fu (time spent working hard) solely to martial arts (creative skill of fighting). Rather Kung Fu is referring to a skill or skills in a variety of subjects, and not just martial arts affiliated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kung (Gung) = Skillful work </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Fu = Time Spent</span></p>
<p align="CENTER"><span style="font-size: medium;">Kung Fu (Gung Fu) = Time Spent on Skillful Work</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER">Kung Fu</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">For instance, in today’s time when one speaks of Kung Fu, those involved immediately perceive it as martial arts—more specifically Chinese martial arts. However, this view contradicts the literal translation of kung fu as it predicates to a single subject. Kung fu is a meaning of achievement in a subject; be it in medicine, industry, mathematics, culinary or martial arts. It represents the training process that one had to go through—the strengthening of mind and body, the learning and the knowledge gained from it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Take for example one that acquires self-achievement in the knowledge of medicine through a long period of time; in comparison, there may be slight difference from one that acquired self-achievement in a martial art. Considering that both went through intense years and massive amounts of effort to reach their goal, it is difficult to deny that both carry kung fu skills. In this case you would say that the person has kung fu in medicine and the other person’s kung fu is in martial arts. </span></p>
<h2>Kung fu to Wushu</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The misuse of the word kung fu traces back to the misinterpretation of the word in Asian movie dubbings and subtitles. Since then Westerners often use it in its false pretense and is even defined the same way in the Oxford English Dictionary. Asia, even China, adopted the English definition of kung fu in the late twentieth century. The accurate term used that describes Chinese martial arts is Wu Shu. Wu, when translated, means “war”, and shu translates to “art”. Fully translated, wu shu means “the art of war” (which is also the title of Sun Tzu’s well known book).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Wu = War Shu = Art</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"> Wu Shu = the Art of War </span></p>
<h2>Chinese Martial art roots</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Much of the philosophy that Chinese martial arts follows is deeply rooted in eastern religious doctrines. The three that has the greatest impact in the evolution of Chinese martial arts are Daoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. What Chinese martial arts took from Daoism is the important teaching of the harmony between Yin and Yang. It is universal that for something to exist it will have an opposing force. Buddhism teaches the importance of all life and the need of one avoiding suffering through self-cultivation. Its use of practicing self-defense and learning make it an essential aspect in Chinese martial arts. </span></p>

<h2>Body Trinity</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">It also focuses on three aspects that make the human: the spirit, mind and body (some may refer to it as the “trinity”).</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> The body contains all that we are—all that we are made up of—the legs, arms, torso, etc. although it may be a healthy body it is an instrument that can be improved upon. The mind is what drives us to live the lives we live and is fed with knowledge and information. Feeding it positive information will have a parallel effect on the body and will greater ones existence. </span></p>
<p><strong>There is specific amount of time that it takes to achieve &#8220;kung fu&#8221; in Chinese arts. For some it may take a single decade, others it may take many! It all depends on your effort and dedication!</strong></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">What is Kendo? <i>Kenjutsu,&nbsp;</i>founded on the principle of</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>setsunin-to</i></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;(life-taking sword) was the base for Kendo historically. </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Katsujin-ken<i> </i></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">(life-giving sword) and Katsujin&nbsp;referred to as “the sword that animates the sword fighter” are now the modern principles for Kendo. In essence, the focus shifted from taking a life to improving ones own life through Kendo&#8217;s Practice.</span></span></p>
<h2>What is Kendo: The Practice</h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In classical bugei [traditional Japanese military arts] parlance, the connotations are concrete. The “sword” refers not to the weapon itself but to its usage. When referring to combat the </span></span>opponent&#8217;s&nbsp;responses and fighting spirit taken, not his life. When a combatant uses force of will to overpower, immobilize, and strike down an opponent before he can react, this is called “setsunin-tõ” (i.e. “sword[smanship] that transfixes”, or ‘swordsmanship that kills response”). “Katsujin-ken” (“Swordsmanship] that animates”), on the other hand, involves drawing out the opponent, inducing him to strike, and then going inside his technique, countering it either at the moment of origination or at the point of its most complete extension. Setsunin-tõ is an egoistic and risky approach to combat – the slightest miscalculation will result in the swordsman walking straight into the opponent’s counterattack. Katsujin-ken, by contrast, involves a sophisticated manipulation of the opponent and his actions by means of utter selflessness, properly conducted, it is virtually undefeatable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Taken from: &#8220;Karl F. Friday,</span></span></span><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><i>Legacies of the Sword: The Kashima-Shinryu and Samurai Martial Culture</i></span></span></span><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">, Honolulu: University of Hawai’i Press, 1997: p. 31&#8243;.</span></span></span></p>
<h2>The Tools of Kendo: SHinai and Kendoka</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In short, The concept of Kendo is to apply the principles of the katana to discipline the human character. Consequently, seldom does kendo ever use the actual katana. Kendo practitioners, called Kendoka, utilize a Shinai for full contact sparring practice. The Shinai formed from four bamboo staves and leather. Alternatively, Kendoka&nbsp;would use a bokken or bokuto made from solid wood to practice basics and forms (or kata).&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-8190 aligncenter" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/24104041/images.jpg" alt="" width="238" height="248"></p>
<h2>Kata</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Karate, Taekwondo, and Kendo, etc.</span></span>&nbsp;Employ a system of detailed patterns of movement&nbsp;or Kata. Moreover, each form of Kata deeply illustrates numerous aspects of the art. Kendo&#8217;s Katas are usually performed with a bokken&nbsp;as previously noted. Overall, each of the Kendo katas “…studies a single set of concepts in a very pure setting allowing the practitioner to delve deeply into these concepts” (kendo-usa, 2009). Kendo kata is performed with two people, the <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Uchitachi</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> and the </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Shidachi.</span></span>&nbsp;T<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">he Uchitachi always sets the pace and distance. </span></span>In addition, the Uchitachi is also the first to attack and the Shidachi initiates the proper response to it. Participants demonstrate the first seven Katas equipped with a long sword. Finally, Kendoka perform the last 3&nbsp;with a short and long sword. The short sword demonstrating the proper defense against a long sword attack.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> All things considered, Kata is only a part of the training in Kendo. Like our training here at Sifu Och Wing Chun, as well as many other martial arts, Kendo requires a great deal of discipline and dedication to its training. From its teachings one will learn etiquette, proper sword handling and different postures and foot work. With these instructions and training one will be able to define their way in life as well as develop a rich outlook on it—“they will be able to put the culture of Kendo into use, thereby benefitting from its value in their everyday lives through increased social vigor (AJFK, 2007).</span></span></p>
<h2>What is Kendo</h2>
<p><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The purpose of practicing kendo is:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">To mold the mind and body,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">To cultivate a vigorous spirit,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">And through correct and rigid training,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Strive for Improvement in the art of Kendo;<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Hold in esteem human courtesy and honor,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Associate with others with sincerity,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">And to forever pursue the cultivation of oneself.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Thus will one be able to love his country and society,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">To contribute to the development of culture,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">And to promote peace and prosperity among all people.</span></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif"><span style="font-size: medium">The straight punch, or jab, is a widely used technique used in almost every existing martial art. Though different arts may vary slightly in how they deliver this technique, the biggest difference lies in how they defend against it. Some martial arts will block the blow with a stagnant defense. Others will avoid contact completely by dodging or evading by moving in or to the side. This article will analyze how some of the most popular martial arts in the world defend against that attack.<br />
</span></span></p>
<h2>Martial Arts Punch Defense Variations</h2>
<h3><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif"><span style="font-size: medium"><b>Tae Kwon Do, Karate and Muay Thai </b></span></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif"><span style="font-size: medium">Tae Kwon Do, Karate, and Muay Thai are similar in their defense of punches in that they block the attack in a hard stop that accepts much of the energy. The most popular punch defense in Tae Kwon Do is either an in-to-outside or an out-to-inside block. To perform this block, one will start in the guard, one arm across the body and the other fist up by the face, by bringing the front arm either from the outside-in or inside-out of the body; this pushes the punch off course. Karate starts from the same guard, but will employ a box block. The box block will move up, down, left or right, but only by a few inches; choosing to take an angle so that not so much force is necessary. In Muay Thai, the most common punch defense is accepting the blow to the guard. To form the guard, one will place both fists on the forehead while keeping the elbows in tight. The Muay Thai practitioner may turn slightly to deflect some of the blow, but the guard will absorb most of the blow.</span></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif"><span style="font-size: medium"><b>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Aikido, and Judo</b></span></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif"><span style="font-size: medium">These martial arts prefer to take an angle to the oncoming offense, desiring to not incur quite as much damage. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) defends mostly against ground techniques, though they acknowledge that most fights will start in stand-up. A BJJ practitioner may dodge the punch altogether, coming in with a take-down. To handle punches from the ground, much like the Muay Thai practitioner, one will use a guard. Aikido is all about redirecting energy in a circular fashion. The Aikido practitioner may block to the outside of the opponents hand, continuing the momentum in a circle – usually ending in some kind of lock. Judo, like BJJ, does not like to address the punch directly. A Judo practitioner may side step the punch, following through with some form of lock or wrist manipulation.</span></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif"><span style="font-size: medium"><b>Krav Maga and&nbsp;</b>Wing Chun</span></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif"><span style="font-size: medium">Krav Maga and Wing Chun fall somewhere in the middle of our previous two groups in their defense against punches; both desire minimal movement, taking the path of least resistance. In Krav Maga, a practitioner will start with both hands open and in front of the face, stepping to the side and pushing one hand out to meet the oncoming punch; directing it off target. Wing Chun will start off similarly to Krav Maga, with both hands open and up by the face, though one hand will be reaching farther out than the other. The hand closest to the oncoming punch will push out, palm up, commanding the space that the opponents punch was in. An alternative to that is to intercept it with a straight punch of their own.<br />
</span></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif"><span style="font-size: medium"><b>Conclusion</b></span></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif"><span style="font-size: medium">All of these martial arts will teach more than one way to defend against a punch, and can by no means be boxed into a few sentences. Each of these examples, rather, displays the arts’ mentality when defending a punch – which can be just as important as the actual move. Whether your goal is to stop a punch in its’ tracks, redirect it, or dodge it completely, being able to defend against a straight punch is a necessity in any art. </span></span></p>

<p>I remember my first introduction to Wing Chun Kung Fu was an Ip Man movie three years ago.&nbsp; I did not know much about it, but the movie inspired me to research it.&nbsp; I liked the theory behind and thought it would be more practical for myself.&nbsp; High flying kicks, although cool looking, are not my style.&nbsp; When I finally had the opportunity to attend a class near my house I thought, this is great.</p>
<p>The instruction and encouragement I receive is outstanding.&nbsp; Sihing Garret and Sifu Och inspire me to dedicate myself and continue training.</p>

<p><a href="http://tampawingchunkungfu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://tampawingchunkungfu.com/</a> The Best Tampa Bay Wing Chun school in my opinion, and I hope to be an inspiring instructor one day. &nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to progressing and to be a good representative of Tampa Bay Wing Chun Kung Fu and Sifu Och Wing Chun.</p>
<p>Not just in wrist against wrist but in everyday applications.&nbsp; I react to things such as doors flying at my face, I caught one with a Jum Sau action.&nbsp; The lady next to me said “Wow! That was like a ninja!”&nbsp; I also catch the items knocked off shelves with a lot more ease.&nbsp; The wrist against wrist drill has helped my sensitivity improve into reaction.&nbsp; It has given me more confidence in handling myself.&nbsp; I always knew my normal movements gave me power but now I am learning to channel that power more efficiently through stance and technique.&nbsp; I am more confident that I’m more prepared for situations when I’m out on the town or at work. &nbsp;&nbsp;I believe there are many applications I could have used previously in my life as a football player.&nbsp; Namely the footwork and center line punch drill.&nbsp; Both would have greatly helped me as an offensive lineman and coach.&nbsp; It also adds to my overall scariness.</p>
<h2>WING CHUN&nbsp;IN TAMPA BAY &nbsp;|&nbsp;EFFECTIVE&nbsp;MARTIAL ARTS</h2>
<p>As the days grow closer to my son’s birth, I look forward to sharing Wing Chun with him.&nbsp; I hope he will benefit from Wing Chun training developing skill, balance and confidence.&nbsp; I see Wing Chun as an opportunity to develop father and son bonds.</p>
<p>I would also like to share a&nbsp;little bit of Wing Chun History with you,&nbsp;a southern Chinese martial art mentioned during the period of the Red Boat Opera in the Late 1800s.&nbsp; Developed by southern Shaolin monks to help combat the Manchurians.&nbsp; It is influenced by other Fujian martial arts that preferred short steps and close fighting, with arms placed close to the chest and elbows close to the flanks offering protection.&nbsp; A simple boxing form quickly mastered by dedicated practitioners.&nbsp; Two key figures keeping Wing Chun system alive after the burning of southern temples were Yat Chum Dai Si, 22<sup>nd</sup> generation Siu Lam Grandmaster monk, and Cheung Ng, also known as Tan Sao Ng within the opera.&nbsp; It was taught to other rebels taking refuge with the opera.&nbsp; From there it spread along the coast and rivers of south-eastern China by people who lived by and on the water.&nbsp; The Shaolin nun myth was most likely created to protect the identities of the creators and perpetuators of the Wing Chun system.&nbsp; Wing Chun translates to Spring Chant or Spring Praise.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not many martial arts base their concept on the use of an object. Fencing, Iaido, and Kendo are the&nbsp;few which do. Fencing revolves around the use of the rapier. Iaido Practitioners utilize the katana. Finally, similar to Iaido, Kendo&#8217;s training involves preparation for the use of a Katana with a Shima. Here in Kendo&#8217;s History, we will focus on the history of Kendo&nbsp;including&nbsp;its origins as a 2 part series. In Part 2, we will change our focus to its practice.</p>
<h2>KenDo&#8217;s Meaning</h2>
<p>Kendo structures its art around the Japanese sword. Coincidentally, Kendo&nbsp;derives its name from the same. “Ken” is the Japanese character meaning sword, and “Do” is the character meaning way or path.&nbsp;Kendo is literally translated as “The way of the sword”. Like <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/marketing/wing-chun-kung-fu-classes/">Wing Chun kung fu</a>, the exact origin of the art is unknown, and its history does not link back to any founder. Based on historical studies, the&nbsp;history of Kendo stems from kenjutsu (the art of the sword) over several centuries. Both swordsman and Samurai played key roles in keeping it alive.</p>
<h2>HISTORY of Kendo</h2>
<p>Like Kendo, Kenjutsu&#8217;s origin is uncertain. The&nbsp;history of Kendo can, however, be traced back to the Heian period (794-1185). During that time its congruent years allowed the Samurai to perfect their sword techniques. The martial art was not highly sought after until the late Muromachi period (1336-1568). At that time,&nbsp;a long civil war ensued and resulted in the establishment of more Kenjutsu schools. After the turmoil in the early years of the Edo period (1603-1867), the concept of kenjutsu underwent a change. The techniques of the art initially focused on killing. Setsunin-to (the life-taking sword) eventually changed to the&nbsp;opposite: katsujin-ken (the life-giving sword). Katsujin-ken focused not only on swordsmanship but also on the discipline of one’s inner-self. Swordsman published many books relaying their theories on swordsmanship. One notable work is Musashi Miyamoto’s “The Book of Five Rings”.</p>
<h2>Modern Kendo</h2>
<p>Modern kendo did not take its form until the Shotoku era (1711-1715). Naganuma Shirozaemon Kunisato of the Jiki-shinkage-ryu school improved on the use of the <i>bogu</i> (armor) as well as the shinai (bamboo sword). He also&nbsp;established a shinai training method. In this continuing era of peace many Samurai established schools (dojos), teaching their art of kenjutsu or traveling from region to region honing their skills in inter-school competitions. Of the many schools during the Edo period in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, three schools became recognized as the “Three Great Dojos of Edo”. These included Renpeikan led by sinsei Saito Yakuro, Shigakken led by sinsei Momoi Shunzo, and Genbukan led by sinsei Chiba Shusaku. Several of Chiba’s techniques are still practiced today.</p>
<h2>Kendo&#8217;s Rise</h2>
<p>With the rise of the Meiji Restoration in 1868, and the abolition of the Samurai, the practice of kenjutsu witnessed a drastic decline. It was not until after an unsuccessful resistance movement on the government in 1877, that&nbsp;the government noticed the benefits of kenjutsu. It began&nbsp;teaching the practice to its Tokyo Metropolitian Police. The forming of the Dai-Nippon Butoku-Kai organization in 1895 allowed for the nationalization of the practice of kenjutsu. The rapidly growing popularity of&nbsp;Kenjutsu&nbsp;soon demanded a universal form. After careful deliberation between schools, Kenjutsu masters created the Nihon Kendo Kata, a set of kendo regulations.</p>
<h2>Kendo Resurrected</h2>
<p>Kendo and its practice remained uninterrupted into World War II, where the occupying allied forces saw kendo as undemocratic. They also saw it as&nbsp;having militaristic associations and outlawed the practice. This&nbsp;also resulted in the disbanding of the Butoku-kai organization. The Ban did not last long. The All Japan Kendo Federation revitalized Kendo with its founding in 1952. The Federation changed Kendo to take the shape of a &#8220;pure sport&#8221; martial art which was vital to its resurrection. The focus shifted from combat to the development of mind and body with the purpose of obtaining a better life for oneself. Furthermore, since the establishment of the International Kendo Federation in 1970, Kendo has made a popular appearances globally with many people wanting to practice the art.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We not only love Wing Chun and its many forms. We love the training practices. While these differ from sifu to sifu, the way training takes place in Karate classes vs Wing Chun classes matters. In &#8220;American&#8221; Karate, the focus is often&nbsp;on moving through a series of&nbsp;belts in order to progress. With a good teacher, point scoring and belts will be less important than mastering techniques. The same goes with&nbsp;Wing Chun, emphasis should always be&nbsp;on mastering each technique until it is second nature and reflexive. Sashes are achievable, and progression is important, but testing should be&nbsp;strict and progress must be deliberate. It&#8217;s clear&nbsp;<a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/karate-and-wing-chun-share-origins/">Karate and Wing Chun share origins</a>, but there are also lots of differences.</p>
<h2>Karate Classes vs Wing Chun Training</h2>
<p>In Karate there are three stances, including the natural, or walking stance (shizentai-dachi), the front stance (zenkutsu-dachi), and the cat stance, or back stance (nekoashi-dachi).&nbsp;Each has its uses, of course. The <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/greatness-wing-chun-stances-rooting/">Wing Chun stance</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/wing-chun-rooting-martial-arts/">Wing Chun rooting</a> is the key&nbsp;of all movements and balance. Everything builds on those well-rooted foundations. One way in which the stances of Wing Chun and Karate classes are similar is that they both&nbsp;have a good center of balance.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;modern Karate belt came about as a badge of honor. Students initially donned a white belt (obi) as part of their uniform. As a natural result of hard training, effort, and time, belts—which were never&nbsp;washed—became darker and darker. Soon, the &#8220;black belt&#8221; became the status symbol&nbsp;of a student who engaged in years of hard work and commitment.</p>
<h2>Wing Chun vs. Karate Classes and Blocking</h2>
<p>You&#8217;re likely to experience a different way of blocking when taking Karate classes vs. Wing Chun.&nbsp;This mostly has to do with the direction the blocks take. In Wing Chun, you&#8217;re constantly blocking back towards the body while Karate blocks flow away from the body. Both require a solid structure in place behind the blocks, so that balance is maintained.</p>
<p>The main difference in Karate blocking is that karate classes typically teach you to &#8220;cock&#8221; your arm back and prepare it for a strike. With Wing Chun, you&nbsp;simultaneously attack with the non-blocking arm. Both Karate and Wing Chun deflect attacks with their blocks, relying on good structure to avoid injury and redirect energy from an attack.</p>
<h2>Which is Right for You?</h2>
<p>So which classes are better? That&#8217;s a loaded question. We obviously prefer the slow, deliberate progression associated with Wing Chun training. We&#8217;re not about awarding belts to keep the interest of students with short attention spans. Rather, we want to train, train, and train some more until your skills are your own. We want you to learn <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/practical-self-defense-stance-structure/">practical self defense</a> skills that will stand up in the real world.</p>
<h2>Watch Out for Online Scams!</h2>
<p>There are several places that offer&nbsp;online Karate classes. Some even promise a &#8220;black belt in 12 months&#8221;. The same could be said for any Wing Chun system that claims you can move through the ranks quickly. Remember, there are no shortcuts! With both Karate and Wing Chun, online classes would be a ridiculous waste of time. Only under the guidance of an experienced teacher can you make true progress in learning practical self-defense skills. Constant and regular evaluations are key to progressing.&nbsp;That&#8217;s something you can&#8217;t do online!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Sifu Och Wing Chun there has arisen a leech. It drains our energy, hinders us from <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/seeing-wing-chun-progress-during-training/">seeing progress during training</a>. The Wing Chun Killer, this leech, is the elongated rotator cuff. He starts off subtly as a uncomfortable annoyance in the front of the shoulder. But before long he has grown to such the monster training at all can become a nightmare of pain. The unbearable pain is enough to stop even the strongest practitioner if not dealt with properly.</p>
<h2>Stop the Wing chun killer</h2>
<p>Many of our coaches and instructors deal with this pain. It is caused by the elongation of the rotator cuffs, mainly the Teres Minor. This tends to happen due to the fact that the anterior deltoid and the pectoral muscles get a lot of use with Wing Chun. Its direct attacks firing straight off the shoulder strengthens only the anterior portion of the&nbsp;shoulder as well as the pectoral (chest) muscles. Without proper muscular compensation to counter act that strength the head of the Humerous will sit in a rolled forward position. With the rotator cuffs elongated any use in the shoulder can not only cause pain but fatigue as well. &nbsp;You can see in the pictures below the shoulder position in it&#8217;s correct form and incorrect form. You will also see the rotator cuffs in the next photo to better understand what is happening.</p>

<h2>Fight back</h2>
<p>Now that we have identified the “Wing Chun Killer”, stretched and weak rotator cuffs, what&#8217;s the solution? The solution is twofold and simple: stretch out the muscles that are tight and strengthen the muscles that are being overpowered by the tight ones. To do this we must understand what muscles are being used. To counter-act the muscles pulling forward we must strengthen the rhomboids and rotator cuffs. The rhomboids must be included because of the role the scapula or shoulder blade. As you can see in the photo above the rotator cuffs actually attach to the scapula. If the rhomboids are also loose the rotator cuffs will not have a good anchor. The rhomboids attach from the spine to the scapulas and are used to retract the scapula towards the spine. View the photo below to better understand the rhomboid.</p>
<p>We already know now that rhomboids pull the scapula towards the spine lets look at the rotator cuffs. The rotator cuffs are used to rotate the shoulder posteriorly and hold it in a stable position. So what type of workouts should you do to help strengthen these muscles. In the videos below you will see some exercises to work out those rotator cuffs and a second video to help make sure that you are doing them correctly.</p>
<h2>Watch These now</h2>
<p>These videos are from Jeff Cavalier who is a Personal Trainer for professional athletes but comes from a physical therapy background.</p>

<p>These techniques have helped many students here at <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com">Sifu Och Wing Chun</a> to minimize and eliminate the pain in their shoulders. You also want to make sure that you stretch out your pectoral muscles. To do this simply find a corner, spread your arms and lean into the corner. You can also grab a door frame with one arm and twist away from it. &nbsp;As you train and become stronger make sure you seek to build your body has a whole unit! We hope this helps you on your Wing Chun journey!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throughout martial art history there has always been a quest for the final move. The ultimate takedown of any opponent no matter the size. Unfortunately, such a technique does not exist. Nor is there an art that is the end all to other arts. However, within one&#8217;s art there can exist techniques which can provide simple answers to complicated questions. Since Wing Chun is about being direct and simple we should always seek the most efficient choice. We also don&#8217;t want to leave ourselves open to <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/wing-chun-weakness-part-ii/">Wing Chun weaknesses</a>. I only had a weekend to show you three techniques, these are what I would choose. They are simple enough to learn within that weekend but they are also effective enough to make a big difference. So you must learn these three moves:&nbsp;Intercepting Fist, Jum Sao, and the Inside Low Shadow Kick.</p>
<h2 align="LEFT">Learn these Three Moves</h2>
<h3 align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000000;">Intercepting Fist</span></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-7895 size-large" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103815/IMG_7697-800x533.jpg" alt="img_7697" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103815/IMG_7697.jpg 800w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103815/IMG_7697-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103815/IMG_7697-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103815/IMG_7697-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103815/IMG_7697-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-7898 size-large" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103824/IMG_7684-800x533.jpg" alt="img_7684" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103824/IMG_7684.jpg 800w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103824/IMG_7684-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103824/IMG_7684-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103824/IMG_7684-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103824/IMG_7684-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Intercepting Fist does exactly what it&#8217;s name implies: it intercepts a strike instead of blocking. With the proper timing there is no need to block and then attack which makes this a very dangerous technique. Firing off the <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/wing-chun-centerline-theory2/">Wing Chun&nbsp;centerline</a> with a shift of the body it is powerful and effective. It uses the forearm to deflect an oncoming strike off the line. When deflected it allows the fist to continue on it&#8217;s course to the intended target. This strike is used mainly against attacks coming down the middle in a straight line. Curved attacks need something else, bringing me to the next move.</p>
<h3 align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000000;">Jum Sao</span></h3>
<p align="LEFT"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-7897 size-large" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103822/IMG_7689-800x533.jpg" alt="img_7689" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103822/IMG_7689.jpg 800w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103822/IMG_7689-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103822/IMG_7689-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103822/IMG_7689-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103822/IMG_7689-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-7899 size-large" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103828/IMG_7680-800x533.jpg" alt="img_7680" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103828/IMG_7680.jpg 800w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103828/IMG_7680-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103828/IMG_7680-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103828/IMG_7680-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103828/IMG_7680-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p align="LEFT">Jum Sao, one of the most versatile techniques in all of Wing Chun. It can be used against almost any initial strike. Driving from the elbow with a reverse L shape it can be used to deflect straight punches (jabs and crosses etc), uppercuts, and even front kicks. When doubled up, two Jum Saos simultaneously, it can be used to block outside kicks: Roundhouses Etc. It can even be used to assist in takedown defense! Not only does it stop the straight attacks but it can be used against wild hooks (not tight hooks) as a last resort. With it&#8217;s wide range of uses the Jum is a must for the Wing Chun practitioner!</p>
<h3 align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000000;">Inside Low Shadow Kick</span></h3>
<p align="LEFT"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-7896 size-large" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103818/IMG_7690-e1477588431653-400x600.jpg" alt="img_7690" width="400" height="600" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103818/IMG_7690-e1477588431653-400x600.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103818/IMG_7690-e1477588431653-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103818/IMG_7690-e1477588431653-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103818/IMG_7690-e1477588431653.jpg 533w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-7900 size-large" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103831/IMG_7692-800x533.jpg" alt="img_7692" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103831/IMG_7692.jpg 800w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103831/IMG_7692-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103831/IMG_7692-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103831/IMG_7692-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103831/IMG_7692-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-7901 size-large aligncenter" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103833/IMG_7687-e1477589214518-400x600.jpg" alt="img_7687" width="400" height="600"></p>
<p align="LEFT">To finish off the trio I want to present the Inside Low Shadow Kick. Comparable to a stomp, it can be used to stop other kicks, blow out knees, and break ankles. Since it is kept low it is hard to see coming and can be used very quickly off the front foot. The foot turned away from the body it uses the heel to drive through the intended target. The most common target is the inside or outside of the knee. When combined with a deflection or strike it is near impossible to avoid or stop.</p>
<h2 align="LEFT">Conclusion</h2>
<p align="LEFT">So there you have it! Intercepting Fist, Jum Sao, and Inside Low Shadow Kick. Wing Chun&#8217;s knowledge goes deep; there are many effective and powerful techniques. However these three standout due to their simplicity. Learn these three moves and your Wing Chun will have a solid base. Be simple, direct, and devastating!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>On the street, the eyes are one of the best targets. But, how to attack them? Wing Chun Biu Jee, or "thrusting fingers" is a great tool for such a devastatingly effective target.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to fighting someone larger or stronger than yourself, you need to exploit every advantage possible. This is the key to surviving a street confrontation versus a sporting event. The mentality of &#8220;fighting dirty&#8221; could be the deciding factor on ones ability to survive an attack from a larger opponent, or potentially multiple opponents. One of the targets considered illegal in a sporting event is the eyes. On the street, however, it is one of the best targets to aim for. But how do you&nbsp;attack it? Wing Chun Biu Jee (Bil Jee), or &#8220;thrusting fingers&#8221; is a great tool for such a target.</p>
<h2>Using Wing Chun Biu Jee (Bil Jee)</h2>
<p>The Biu Jee&#8217;s primary use is offensive, but it can be used defensively. Before addressing either of these let us address the structure of the Biu Jee or Bil Jee. Since Wing Chun&#8217;s focus is to protect the centerline while finding the most direct route to another&#8217;s, the Biu Jee is shaped in a way that when retracted, can easily protect the ribs of the user. The lead hand comes straight out from the shoulder, and the wrist is curved away from the body. This shape not only allows the eyes to be attacked, but it can also be used as a defense intercept of a jab or cross.</p>
<p>The second hand has two options: It can either be kept in a <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/how-to-wu-sau-correctly/">Wu Sau&nbsp;position</a>, (hand in the center of the chest pressed outward, fingers pulled back) or a secondary Biu Jee. The secondary Biu Jee is kept chambered under the elbow of the primary hand. This secondary hand allows for a quick release of that hand. This serves two functions: It allows firing a follow up Biu Jee or clearing a hand pressing in on the elbow of the other arm.</p>
<h2>Using the Hand with Biu Jee Thrusting Fingers</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7807" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/24103726/Wing-Chun-Bui-Jee-Thrusting-Fingers-Cheung-194x300.jpg" alt="Wing Chun Bui Jee Thrusting Fingers William Cheung" width="194" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/24103726/Wing-Chun-Bui-Jee-Thrusting-Fingers-Cheung-194x300.jpg 194w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/24103726/Wing-Chun-Bui-Jee-Thrusting-Fingers-Cheung-400x619.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/24103726/Wing-Chun-Bui-Jee-Thrusting-Fingers-Cheung-388x600.jpg 388w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/24103726/Wing-Chun-Bui-Jee-Thrusting-Fingers-Cheung.jpg 517w" sizes="(max-width: 194px) 100vw, 194px" />Moving on to the hand itself and how it is used, there are again two options. The hand, if striking towards the eyes, should actually be kept loose. If the fingers are stiff there is a likely chance of a break due to the eye being encased in bone. There is an exception to this: The fingers can and should be stiff if using the same technique when striking the throat. With a fast whipping motion, the fingers are thrust forward into the eye of the opponent simulating the striking of a snake.</p>
<p>If the eye is missed, the finger will simply collapse against the pressure only causing minor discomfort versus a break. The attacker may not have been dealt any serious damage but with a strike going towards the eyes he is almost sure to close his eyes or at least pull his head away. This is the perfect moment to follow up with another attack.</p>
<p>When you combine the elbow structure and the hand shape, you now have a tool that has multiple uses. As mentioned earlier, it can be used to intercept strikes from the outside. It&#8217;s also&nbsp;quite useful from the inside against hooks. Since the elbow is kept below the hand, similar to the shape of a Tan Sau, it can be thrust towards the bicep crease of an arm to be used defensively. The same concept applies (as mentioned earlier) against a jab or a cross.</p>
<h2>Application</h2>
<p>In application, the Biu Jee can be used in quick succession against a quick Jab and cross combo. First, you can intercept the Jab from the outside. Then, depending on the situation, you can slip the cross on the inside and take the center.&nbsp;You can also redirect the cross off, and take the opposite side. With the opponent committed in their cross, their structure can now be compromised with that outside angle.</p>
<p>On the street, you have to do what you can to survive. If that means jabbing someone in the eyes to get home safely, do it. The Biu Jee is a great tool. Offensively and defensively, it can be fired quickly and easily against very common attacks or for a direct line to disrupt and seriously damage your opponent. Effective and direct, it is a tool everyone should have in their street arsenal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Wu Sau is a basic defensive position for many Wing Chun moves. If one hand is attacking then the other hand is usually going to be in the Wu Sau position. The Wu Sau not only serves as a back up block, it can also be turned into an offensive technique (punch, grab,chop, etc.) if the need arises. Understanding how to Wu Sau correctly is more important than you may think.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">How to Wu Sau Correctly</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The problem with the Wu Sau for many students, especially in the beginning, is the Wu Sau is not being performed correctly which will make the Wu Sau ineffective. The most common issue with a Wu Sau is that it is held too close to the body to be useful as either a block or an attack. When the Wu Sau is held close to the body, it is “collapsed” meaning if it was meant to be a block then it has no power to withstand the force of the opponent’s attack. If the Wu Sau was meant as a way to attack and its still too close to the body, then it is also going to be ineffective because the ability to produce any power behind a punch, paak, etc is going to be compromised because of its collapsed position.</p>
<p>Being sure your Wu Sau is in the correct position is not as difficult as it may seem. Be sure your Wu Sau hand is no closer to your body than the inside crease of your opposite elbow. Its also very important that the Wu Sau hand is pressing outward and the fingers are pulled back toward the body. The boney part of the wrist is what should be pushed outward. While the fingers are being pulled back, don’t forget to keep your fingers together and your thumb should not stick out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wing Chun Kung Fu is known for being an extremely fast martial art. Allowing the practitioner to counter and intercept in the blink of an eye. Following these with a continuous flow that can utterly stun and surprise most, if not all opponents. Within this flow is a special technique that Wing Chun uses that can cause an immediate concussion if done properly. You need to master the Wing Chun Double Punch.</p>
<p>Most styles popular styles, Karate, Boxing, Tae Kwon Do, Muai Thai, alternate their punches typically from left to right to create combinations. For instance in boxing: Jab, Cross, Hook, Upper Cut, is a very basic combination taught from the beginning. From there, further combinations can be created. To do this, a practitioner must turn his body away to complete the strike. The body is then rotated back into the strike from the opposite shoulder to allow the other hand to strike. While of course, not every combo alternates at every strike, that is the bulk of the attacks.</p>
<p>One of the main differences with Wing Chun, is that while in some instances also alternating between the left and right hand, it does not twist the body. Wing Chun keeps both hips forward allowing both hands to stay in range. When a punch is thrown the entire body lurches forward to give power to the strikes. You can also see this with the <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/whipping-punch-broken-down-explained/">Wing Chun whipping punch</a>.</p>
<h2>A Double Punch&nbsp;Concussion</h2>
<p>When the brain collides with the skull, a concussion usually follows. Imagine a strike that causes the brain to rattle inside the skull resulting in extreme damage. That is the purpose of the Double Punch. With the Wing Chun Stance allowing both hands to be forward the Double Punch can now be used. It is shaped by placing one fist at the wrist crease line of the first fist. Since the elbows are kept in tight, it gives the shape of two “straight” punches lined one behind the other.</p>
<p>Both fists travel out together until contact. Once the first fist has made contact it is lowered and immediately followed by the second fist. Since the entire body is thrown into the strike both hits have the full force of the body. The initial strike rocks the head back and the second causes the rattle due to the quickness between the strikes.</p>
<p>At Sifu Och Wing Chun the Double Punch is taught early on. They are difficult to understand and train but once understood they can be placed into almost any combination to compliment and enhance an attack. They are quick and powerful, and most of all effective. Along with the attack capabilities The structure of the double punch also allows for a quick and easy cover should an uppercut or body shot come from the opponent. Since the elbows are kept tight the arms are able to sink in and protect the ribs very quickly. With the ability to throw this type of strike at any point in a fight it gives the right person, with the right training, a chance against any attacker. This attack allows one to fire a powerful attack from a defensive starting point.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finally, the only way to develop your double punch is resistance. Using a heavy bag for raw power and focus mitts and a partner for speed, timing, and distance, the Double Punch can be fully developed. Just like boxers learn how to strike right from day one, so it is with Sifu Och Wing Chun. To many schools get lost in forms, and drills and forget to hit! Find a good bag and friend. Train hard and long. If you can learn the Double Punch, develop it well, you can actually say that you have a punch that&#8217;s faster than most others!</p>
