]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learning martial arts is much like a knife. You will take your training through stages before you can use it. The two main stages involved are crafting the knife and sharpening the knife. When to Learn Wooden Dummy &amp; Chi Sau depends on your view point in regards to these stages. I will speak from the perspective that I was taught at Sifu Och Wing Chun. That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that it is the &#8220;correct&#8221; way, it is simply how we do it here.</p>
<h2>Knowing when to teach Wooden Dummy &amp; Chi Sau</h2>
<p>Stage 1 &#8211; The view point that is at Sifu Och Wing Chun is one based in immediate application. When a student walks into our door we want to teach them street applicable techniques as soon as possible. We have had multiple students come into our studio living in dangerous situations. Our first advice is always to get away from the situation or people causing the problems. But when it comes to the techniques we can&#8217;t teach them Chi Sau or Wooden Dummy because at that moment it is not applicable.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2561" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2561" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-2561 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/24102023/IMG_5447-300x200.jpg" alt="women's self defense in lakeland florida women self defense sifu justin och wing chun kung fu martial arts" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/24102023/IMG_5447-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/24102023/IMG_5447-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/24102023/IMG_5447-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/24102023/IMG_5447-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/24102023/IMG_5447.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2561" class="wp-caption-text">women&#8217;s self defense in lakeland florida women self defense sifu justin och wing chun kung fu martial arts</figcaption></figure>
<p>They must be able to deal with dangerous situations and attacks immediately. We want to equip them with a basic defense against hooks, hard straight punches, take-downs, pushes, grabs etc. Once they have an established based we want to add onto their skill by adding combinations, transitions, and working against and with weapons. Finally, free sparring to train you on how to use and deal with other martial arts combat reactions.</p>
<h2>The Need for Chi Sau</h2>
<p>Now, the argument might be made that without Chi Sau it will be difficult to enhance certain aspects of your reflexes. To this I agree to a point. In Chi Sau you deal with close quarter sensitivity reaction as well as redirection and close range trapping. So it is a vital aspect of training Wing Chun.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-4181 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24102505/lakeland-fl-self-defense-lakeland-fl1-300x182-300x182.jpg" alt="wing chun classes" width="300" height="182">However, for the new student, Chi Sau may be difficult to use as a tool. You must train Chi Sau to learn structure before using it for reaction. Making sure that you have constant forward energy, balanced strength, and good relaxation can takes weeks to months of hard training.To fill in the gab between sparring and Chi Sau we use wrist against. This is essentially Chi Sau reaction hands without the rolling.</p>
<p>The same is essentially true with the wooden dummy. But instead of referring to reaction the wooden dummy would deal with structure and positioning refinement.</p>
<p>Stage 2</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7055 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/24103123/grandmaster-ip-chun-eldest-son-of-ip-man-sifu-justin-och-hong-kong-china-300x216.jpg" alt="grandmaster ip chun, Ip Chun, eldest son of ip man, ip man, sifu justin och, hong kong china" width="300" height="216">Stage 2 can be equated to the sharpening of the knife. You now have a good solid foundation in your techniques. You know how to apply them and it what situation they should be used. Now we must work to make them stronger, easier, more efficient. This is the perfect place for Chi Sau and Wooden Dummy. With the correct context in mind when applying the techniques, the refinement of them now has a purpose.</p>
<h3>The Knife</h3>
<p>Reverting back to the knife analogy. Imagine having a slab of metal and sharpening one side of it. Now, what do you have? A slab of metal with a sharp end. There is no way to use it as desired. Building the knife takes time. The handle, the guard if wanted, the length. You must make this part of the knife first before you can sharpen it. If you do not you are not only going to have a much hard time sharpening it but you will have an unusable knife.</p>
<p>Now, this goes without saying, all of the above depends on your goals. If you are seeking to learn Wing Chun to find balance in your life. Develop your mind and find new friends, then learning these aspects of Wing Chun sooner than later makes sense. However, if you are looking for the combat of Wing Chun then saving that for later is suggested for When to Learn Wooden Dummy &amp; Chi Sau.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ability to close the distance with an opponent is essential to any Wing Chun practitioner. You must be able to quickly respond to an opponents attack and shut them down to avoid follow up attacks. Different ranges call for different responses. That being said we will cover a few Wing Chun Entry Techniques here in this article. Before reading this article we suggesting checking out our previous article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/wing-chun-vs-jab-cross-hook-takedown/">Wing Chun Vs Jab, Cross, Hook Takedown Combo. </a>We explain the difference between committed and non-committed strikes which is essential to your training.</p>
<h2>Hand Entries</h2>
<h3>Paak Slip</h3>
<p>In our previous article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/wing-chun-vs-jab-cross-hook-takedown/">Wing Chun Vs Jab, Cross, Hook Takedown Combo</a> we touch on the idea of using the Paak to simply slip off the first punch. Connected is a video of Master Sifu demonstrating this technique. He explains how to utilize the Paak to deflect the initial blow and then glide off into a strike. A very effective and quick technique.</p>
<h3>Paak Punch</h3>
<p>The Paak Punch is a very effective combo to use. Instead of trading blow for blow with an opponent, the Paak Punch allows you to strike and defend at the same time. When countering a cross or straight punch this is a definite must. You are able to either crush a punch and counter above it with a punch of your own. Or, you can slip the punch and strike the ribs. Either way you are able to immediately counter straight punches and close the distance.</p>
<h3>Paak into Bui or Tan</h3>
<p>If an opponent does not throw a committed strike it can be very difficult to throw a counter. In this case it would be prudent to defect the first punch with a Paak and then counter the second punch. Two great choices would be either a Tan Punch or Bui Sao Punch.</p>
<p>A Tan Punch would be a great choice against any sort of straight punch. Since the Paak would have simply deflected the first punch you can use this as a set up for the second punch counter.</p>
<p>If he throws a haymaker or wide hook the Bui Sao Punch would be the best choice. The curved shape of the Bui Sao would match the trajectory of the hook allowing for maximum protection.</p>
<h2>Kick Entries</h2>
<h3>Shadow Kick</h3>
<p>If facing an opponent that moves a lot, pushing off the front foot, a Shadow Kick may be a option to consider. Our article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/kung-fu-kicks/">Kung Fu Kicks</a> goes into more detail about this kick. The idea is to crush into your opponents leg with a stomping motion. Typically aimed to blow out the knee the lead hand will typically drop as a result opening up an nice window for an attack.</p>
<h3>Crescent Kick</h3>
<p>Finally, the Crescent Kick. One of the most effective ways to use this kick is to the ribs when they extend their punch. This has the same shape as the Shadow Kick but instead of going down it strikes forward. You must thrust your entire body behind the kick. When this is done the head usually comes down as a result of the body caving into the kick. This allows for an easy strike to the head.</p>
<h2>The Key to Closing the Gab</h2>
<p>All of these techniques are futile if you do not close the distance with the right timing. You can only develop timing with hours of practice. Doing techniques in lines are a great way to build the structure for them and speed. However, if you do not consistently keep up your training your timing will be off an no amount of skill will help you if you do not time it correctly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Wing Chun vs Jab, Cross, Hook, Takedown</h1>
<p>Wing Chun vs Jab, Cross, Hook, Takedown was a question a beginner posted for anyone to answer on a Facebook group. He asked for the key to using&nbsp;Wing Chun vs Jab, Cross, Hook, Takedown Combo. Sifu Justin Och and Senior Instructor Garret Brumfield posted a video titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bfI2MOn_oI">&#8220;Wing Chun vs Jab, Cross, Hook, Takedown Combo&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7bfI2MOn_oI" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>In this article we will address some of the finer points. Stopping&nbsp;this combo is no easy task but Wing Chun does have an answer.</p>
<h2>Wing Chun vs Jab, Cross, Hook, Takedown Combo</h2>
<h3>The Jab</h3>
<p>If you are to deal with an attack you must understand it. To understand strikes you must make a distinction between committed and non-committed strikes. A committed strike could be defined as a strike that has the entire weight of the body fueling the power for the strike. Alternatively, a non-committed strike will be much faster but won&#8217;t have the power. A jab is a non committed strike. That being the case, the counter must be equally fast. As you can see in the video Sifu Och uses his paak sao but immediately follows up with a straight punch. This allows for quick adjustments where needed.</p>
<h3>The Jab, Cross</h3>
<p>If your opponent crosses immediately after his jab you may not have time to follow up off the initial strike. Sifu chose is one of the most direct options to counter although there are many variations. The hand that was used to paak the initial strike simply follows its trajectory to the face. In conjunction, the back hand paaks the next strike. This results in and immediate strike to your opponents face.</p>
<h3>The Jab, Cross, Hook</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s say that your counter does not damage your opponent enough. As a result, he follows up again with a hook. The hook that Sifu Och Demonstrates is a very tight &#8220;rabbit&#8221; hook. Theses types of hooks are very hard to deal with. A Bui Sao, Bui Jee, Man Sao will be very hard to execute in this scenario. You must be able to fully extend these techniques for them to become effective. When the opponent throws this hook, it will be very tight to the body with a lot of torque. Torque equals power, and if you are unable to fully extend your technique it will crumble. In this scenario Sifu chooses to utilize upward elbow to cover the opponents strike. He is now able to strike with is other hand and move on with his attack.</p>
<h3>The Jab, Cross, Hook, Takedown</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8389 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104117/17693117_10211973694912812_345342688_o-225x300.jpg" alt="wing chun vs jab cross hook" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104117/17693117_10211973694912812_345342688_o-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104117/17693117_10211973694912812_345342688_o-400x533.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104117/17693117_10211973694912812_345342688_o-768x1025.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104117/17693117_10211973694912812_345342688_o-450x600.jpg 450w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104117/17693117_10211973694912812_345342688_o.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></p>
<p>Finally, we moved on to dealing last part of the&nbsp;combo. None of your counters have successfully stopped your opponent but because you are in so tight he feels the need to shoot in and take you down.&nbsp;There are two scenarios to be address when an opponent shoots in on you. If he gets under your elbow or not.</p>
<p>If he does not get under your able a you can simple remove the foot he is attacking and stop his forward motion with a Gum or Jum Sao to the neck\head.&nbsp;This is addressed in our article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/fighting-footwork/">Fighting Footwork</a>&nbsp;where we go into a little more depth. However, if he does get behind one of your elbows you must sprawl back or you will be taken down. Once you have sprawled you can then establish a line of defense again with your Jum or Gum Sao. This line allows you to regain your structure and move on with your attack.</p>
<h2>End the fight</h2>
<p>At each stage of the attack your goal as a Wing Chun practitioner should be to the end the fight. When you respond to an attack you should be immediately seeking to follow it up to finish your opponent.&nbsp;You would only utilized these counter techniques if you are unable to flow into and 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc. follow up. So in theory, your opponent will never get to his takedown, or his cross for that matter. However, that is why we as martial artists should always be prepared. If the worst happens, you will be ready.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can have the fastest hands in the world, but if you aren&#8217;t at the right place at the right time that won&#8217;t matter. Foot work is literally the foundation to any style. You may be able to block or evade an attack here and there with good hands or head movement. However, if you do not base your counter with fighting footwork, it will be difficult to execute.</p>
<h2>positioning your Fighting footwork</h2>
<p>Superior angles will make your life much easier. It is much simpler to deal with an opponent when you have minimized their ability to use multiple &#8220;weapons&#8221; at once. In the same way, striking your opponents key points will also be easier when you are positioned correctly. Wing Chun seeks to dominate the outside angle allowing maximum trapping and striking to occur.</p>
<h2>Weight distribution</h2>
<p>There is a big debate among Wing Chun practitioners. Not only about weight distribution through the feet but also between the legs. First let&#8217;s address weight through the feet.</p>
<h3>Heels</h3>
<p>When a weight lifter squats his weight must drive from the middle portion of his foot to his heels. With proper skeletal alignment his structure is locked in place and only the strongest muscles are recruited to move the weight. If alignment is broken serious injury can occur. When finished correctly the weight will be completely on the heels as seen here. <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8359" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104112/squat-form.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="347" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104112/squat-form.jpg 604w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104112/squat-form-400x230.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104112/squat-form-600x345.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104112/squat-form-300x172.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" /></p>
<p>Just as the weight lifting supports his weight with structure, the Wing Chun Fighter supports his power through his alignment. Following the same rules through physiques the weight is on the heel when engaged. This allows strikes at full power to be stopped and maximum strength can be delivered through blows.</p>
<h3>Toes</h3>
<p>Even though the heels are the source of power and structure, speed is seriously inhibited when the weight is focused there. Weight should only be distributed to the toes when looking to utilize speed. Speed is used to gain the correct position. This is typically done before contact is even made. Once connected to your opponent weight should immediately be transferred to the heels to again for power. Closing the distance with an opponent is essential to the Wing Chun Fighter. If he is unable to get to the trapping range it will be difficult to execute proper techniques.</p>
<h2>Stance Distribution</h2>
<p>The final aspect of weight distribution to cover is the amount of weight on each foot.&nbsp; At Sifu Och Wing Chun we typically keep our weight 50-50. The reason behind this is to keep our ability to defend against takedowns. If the weight is distributed to far to one leg you can become susceptible to those types of attacks. Sweeps and single leg takedowns are difficult to stop without even distribution of weight.</p>
<p>To give a specific example, we will look at a single leg takedown&nbsp;defense. First, hand positions: jum to the neck, gan to the arm. (Essentially a Gan Da). This will then become a tan and a fook. The Jum to the neck stops the person from getting to your core. The gan to the arm is used to block them from getting your leg. As a result you gain&nbsp;an underhook. (illustrated below).</p>

<p>In unison the foot that is being attacked must be retracted. The foot must be swept back to avoid getting caught. This all occurs within a split second. If the weight split 70-30, or 60-40, it will be very hard to adjust and defend this type of attack.</p>
<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are many different opinions and reasons about weight distribution. At Sifu Och Wing Chun we keep it mostly 50-50 to maintain the ability to adjust in any direction as quickly as possible. We are then able to shift and adapt to any attack that is thrown our way.</p>

<h3><span style="font-size: medium;">When broken up, martial is referred to as “those inclined to war or fighting”.&nbsp; Art is referred to as “the expression or</span> <span style="font-size: medium;">creative skill and imagination”. Thus, martial arts is to be translated as “the expression of creative fighting skills”. Some (possibly the majority) of the practices still firmly embrace this concept.&nbsp; However there are other practices that use martial arts as a catalyst and add it with the practices philosophy in order to create a new self. In this part of our two part series titled &#8220;Martial Arts Philosophy-Chinese Versus Japanese Part 1&#8221;, we will cover the Chinese side of the two lines of thinking.<br />
</span></h3>
<div id="TextSection" dir="LTR">
<h3><span style="font-size: medium;">Martial = inclined to war or fighting </span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-size: medium;">Art = expression or creative skill</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martial Arts = Expressive or Creative Skill in Fighting </span></h3>
<h2 style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER"><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Chinese Martial Arts</b></span></span></h2>
</div>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Despite it having a combat effectiveness, Kung Fu (also pronounced Gung Fu) is founded on the philosophy of attaining intelligence and wisdow. Two qualities that take years to develop and attain. Additionally, the first character, Kung, when translated, means “training intensely” or “skillful work”. Translation of the second character, fu, refers to “time spent”. Together, Kung Fu may be translated as “time spent training hard” or “spending time on skillful work”. By this translation it is somewhat difficult to pin kung fu (time spent working hard) solely to martial arts (creative skill of fighting). Rather Kung Fu is referring to a skill or skills in a variety of subjects, and not just martial arts affiliated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kung (Gung) = Skillful work </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Fu = Time Spent</span></p>
<p align="CENTER"><span style="font-size: medium;">Kung Fu (Gung Fu) = Time Spent on Skillful Work</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER">Kung Fu</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">For instance, in today’s time when one speaks of Kung Fu, those involved immediately perceive it as martial arts—more specifically Chinese martial arts. However, this view contradicts the literal translation of kung fu as it predicates to a single subject. Kung fu is a meaning of achievement in a subject; be it in medicine, industry, mathematics, culinary or martial arts. It represents the training process that one had to go through—the strengthening of mind and body, the learning and the knowledge gained from it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Take for example one that acquires self-achievement in the knowledge of medicine through a long period of time; in comparison, there may be slight difference from one that acquired self-achievement in a martial art. Considering that both went through intense years and massive amounts of effort to reach their goal, it is difficult to deny that both carry kung fu skills. In this case you would say that the person has kung fu in medicine and the other person’s kung fu is in martial arts. </span></p>
<h2>Kung fu to Wushu</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The misuse of the word kung fu traces back to the misinterpretation of the word in Asian movie dubbings and subtitles. Since then Westerners often use it in its false pretense and is even defined the same way in the Oxford English Dictionary. Asia, even China, adopted the English definition of kung fu in the late twentieth century. The accurate term used that describes Chinese martial arts is Wu Shu. Wu, when translated, means “war”, and shu translates to “art”. Fully translated, wu shu means “the art of war” (which is also the title of Sun Tzu’s well known book).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Wu = War Shu = Art</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"> Wu Shu = the Art of War </span></p>
<h2>Chinese Martial art roots</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Much of the philosophy that Chinese martial arts follows is deeply rooted in eastern religious doctrines. The three that has the greatest impact in the evolution of Chinese martial arts are Daoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. What Chinese martial arts took from Daoism is the important teaching of the harmony between Yin and Yang. It is universal that for something to exist it will have an opposing force. Buddhism teaches the importance of all life and the need of one avoiding suffering through self-cultivation. Its use of practicing self-defense and learning make it an essential aspect in Chinese martial arts. </span></p>

<h2>Body Trinity</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">It also focuses on three aspects that make the human: the spirit, mind and body (some may refer to it as the “trinity”).</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> The body contains all that we are—all that we are made up of—the legs, arms, torso, etc. although it may be a healthy body it is an instrument that can be improved upon. The mind is what drives us to live the lives we live and is fed with knowledge and information. Feeding it positive information will have a parallel effect on the body and will greater ones existence. </span></p>
<p><strong>There is specific amount of time that it takes to achieve &#8220;kung fu&#8221; in Chinese arts. For some it may take a single decade, others it may take many! It all depends on your effort and dedication!</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throughout martial art history there has always been a quest for the final move. The ultimate takedown of any opponent no matter the size. Unfortunately, such a technique does not exist. Nor is there an art that is the end all to other arts. However, within one&#8217;s art there can exist techniques which can provide simple answers to complicated questions. Since Wing Chun is about being direct and simple we should always seek the most efficient choice. We also don&#8217;t want to leave ourselves open to <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/wing-chun-weakness-part-ii/">Wing Chun weaknesses</a>. I only had a weekend to show you three techniques, these are what I would choose. They are simple enough to learn within that weekend but they are also effective enough to make a big difference. So you must learn these three moves:&nbsp;Intercepting Fist, Jum Sao, and the Inside Low Shadow Kick.</p>
<h2 align="LEFT">Learn these Three Moves</h2>
<h3 align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000000;">Intercepting Fist</span></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-7895 size-large" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103815/IMG_7697-800x533.jpg" alt="img_7697" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103815/IMG_7697.jpg 800w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103815/IMG_7697-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103815/IMG_7697-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103815/IMG_7697-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103815/IMG_7697-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-7898 size-large" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103824/IMG_7684-800x533.jpg" alt="img_7684" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103824/IMG_7684.jpg 800w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103824/IMG_7684-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103824/IMG_7684-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103824/IMG_7684-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103824/IMG_7684-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Intercepting Fist does exactly what it&#8217;s name implies: it intercepts a strike instead of blocking. With the proper timing there is no need to block and then attack which makes this a very dangerous technique. Firing off the <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/wing-chun-centerline-theory2/">Wing Chun&nbsp;centerline</a> with a shift of the body it is powerful and effective. It uses the forearm to deflect an oncoming strike off the line. When deflected it allows the fist to continue on it&#8217;s course to the intended target. This strike is used mainly against attacks coming down the middle in a straight line. Curved attacks need something else, bringing me to the next move.</p>
<h3 align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000000;">Jum Sao</span></h3>

<p align="LEFT">Jum Sao, one of the most versatile techniques in all of Wing Chun. It can be used against almost any initial strike. Driving from the elbow with a reverse L shape it can be used to deflect straight punches (jabs and crosses etc), uppercuts, and even front kicks. When doubled up, two Jum Saos simultaneously, it can be used to block outside kicks: Roundhouses Etc. It can even be used to assist in takedown defense! Not only does it stop the straight attacks but it can be used against wild hooks (not tight hooks) as a last resort. With it&#8217;s wide range of uses the Jum is a must for the Wing Chun practitioner!</p>

<p align="LEFT">To finish off the trio I want to present the Inside Low Shadow Kick. Comparable to a stomp, it can be used to stop other kicks, blow out knees, and break ankles. Since it is kept low it is hard to see coming and can be used very quickly off the front foot. The foot turned away from the body it uses the heel to drive through the intended target. The most common target is the inside or outside of the knee. When combined with a deflection or strike it is near impossible to avoid or stop.</p>
<h2 align="LEFT">Conclusion</h2>
<p align="LEFT">So there you have it! Intercepting Fist, Jum Sao, and Inside Low Shadow Kick. Wing Chun&#8217;s knowledge goes deep; there are many effective and powerful techniques. However these three standout due to their simplicity. Learn these three moves and your Wing Chun will have a solid base. Be simple, direct, and devastating!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I first met <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/instructors/sifu-justin-och-chief-wing-chun-instructor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sifu Justin Och</a> almost two years ago. I came into <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/marketing/wing-chun-kung-fu-classes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wing Chun classes</a> with a swarm of new people. Immediately, a swarm of colored shirts and sashes overloaded my senses. The first few months simply delivered&nbsp;a shocking mix of&nbsp;strange movements and the excitement of starting a new martial art. With no previous exposure to martial arts, I amazed&nbsp;myself using simple techniques to block punches. Punches that would not have truly&nbsp;made impact. Moving forward almost two years, I received my green sash and blue shirt. The most important roadblock that I had to overcome involved&nbsp;developing the student&nbsp;mindset behind learning Wing Chun. Without this student mindset, no&nbsp;student will never be successful. Anyone can practice&nbsp;sloppy techniques, but until you&nbsp;develop the student&nbsp;mindset, your martial arts&nbsp;training&nbsp;will never reach the depths of appreciation and effectiveness it deserves.</p>
<h2>Developing the Student Mindset Quickly is Key</h2>
<p>After attending&nbsp;the school for just two years, I&#8217;ve seen hundreds of people walk through the doors and&nbsp;never come back. This usually occurs within the first 6-12 months. They come, participate, and walk away thinking they have studied Wing Chun. The truth, however, is that they have simply been <em>exposed</em> to Wing Chun. Far too many people make the mistake of associating&nbsp;<em>exposure</em>&nbsp;to Wing Chun with&nbsp;actually&nbsp;<em>training</em>&nbsp;in Wing Chun. The crucial difference lies in the mindset of the student. When a person has developed this correct mindset, they truly begin to train.</p>
<p>For the first time ever, after developing this mindset, the student will push their hardest.</p>
<h2>What is the Student Mindset?</h2>
<p>This student mindset goes above simply just reproducing various techniques across various lines done in class. This mindset is about making every single thing you do in class<em> matter</em>. <em>How</em> you train, is how your Wing Chun becomes programmed into your reactions. When you step into class, you are surrounded by an incredible wealth of knowledge and skill. The only thing that can keep you from becoming your best is&nbsp;yourself. Very few people come into this school with the right mindset, but everyone can develop it. The choice is yours. I believe this mindset develops into 4 things: Sweat, Perfection, Blood, and Tears.</p>
<h3>Sweat</h3>
<p>You can’t succeed if you don’t push yourself. These techniques will not mean anything if you just throw them out there and hope for the best. No techniques ever will. When I began developing through the very beginning ranks, I noticed that the upper sashes always seemed to be dripping in sweat. The rest&nbsp;of us were barely out of breath though, we complained about our arms being sore. I then realized that this was even the case when they were doing the exact same thing we were doing. I soon realized that this difference was due to how they trained. The more advanced the student, the harder they trained. This doesn’t necessarily mean that they could punch harder, but rather, they would give it everything they had.</p>
<p>A line that a lower student would do looks lazy in comparison. After a few lines, the upper sash would be breaking out in sweat. This doesn’t at all relate to their endurance, but specifically relates to how they are training. This same exact illustration can apply to workouts. When assigned to&nbsp;give 500 chain punches into the focus mitts, the&nbsp;easy method&nbsp;rushes through without giving much focus&nbsp;behind the strikes. You probably won’t even break a sweat. But what if, instead of just faking your way through the 500 attacks, you made every single one of those punches as hard and fast as you could? By the end of it, you’d be dripping in sweat. How much more did you gain from those same 500 punches? If you’re not sweating, you can be sure you’re not working your hardest.</p>
<h3>Perfection</h3>
<p>There becomes a crucial difference between giving a technique everything you got while still doing the technique, and just hitting as hard as you can. When you are drilling techniques, your focus should first be on perfection. If you train a&nbsp;particular block 100 different times, but 50 of them are&nbsp;sloppy, then when you draw from that “reflex pool” you have a 50% chance of successfully completing that technique. In other words, you have a 50% chance of getting hit by a knockout punch. Those are not the odds you want to be training. When you first learn a combo for example, of course you aren’t going to remember everything. You’re going to have to think about what comes next. So it is important to slow it down for perfection.</p>
<p>Don’t ever excuse a repetitive mistake. If it’s sloppy, if it feels rushed, or if something seems off, fix it. If you don’t know how, ask. There is a wealth of information around you, so use it. Don’t allow yourself to train imperfection. You have to learn how to balance power with perfection. If you go too hard or fast and lose the precision of perfection, you’ve failed to perform the technique. You can perfectly perform and land a technique but fail to make it have damaging power. That means you&#8217;re just&nbsp;tapping your opponent.&nbsp;Neither of these does you any good.</p>
<h3>Blood</h3>
<p>You have to accept the fact that you’re going to be hit. You’re going to bruise. If you can’t perform your techniques against resistance, then they&#8217;re not where they need to be. If you can use it against someone punching you, how can you defend yourself? It should also be noted that you are learning a new martial art: including your own body. This goes above just reproducing a technique. You have to condition your body for this art. It won’t necessarily be the greatest feeling in the world, but if your arms can’t hold up to training, they won’t when you need to defend yourself. Of course, this doesn’t mean that this school is a brutal death cage like gladiator school.</p>
<p>The same thing goes with working out. You are going to get sore lifting weights; you might accidentally drop weights on your feet; you will be exhausted; or you could pull muscles. If you’re too afraid of being hit, or you want to train without being hit, then you’re not training an art to defend yourself. You’re going to get hit. It&#8217;s how you learn to protect against that hit the next time. I get hit every day, usually multiple times, but it doesn’t bloody up my face or break my bones. If you’re not training against true resistance, you will never know if what you’re doing actually works. Here, I know what works. I know what I’m training works because I can prove it.</p>
<h3>Tears</h3>
<p>You’re not as good as you think you are. You’re going to struggle with some things. You’re going to feel like quitting. You’re going to want to stay home and relax instead of coming to class. You’re not alone in any of these feelings. Every single person above you has felt this way multiple times. The question is whether you are going to push through it or not. It comes down to you. It’s not going to be easy, but you can certainly do it. Just keep pushing. Never give up.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I wasted the first year of Wing Chun training without this student mindset and regret it. When I truly started to develop this mindset, my training exploded. I never felt as close to my Wing Chun family as I have now. I crave each day for the information I get. I am able to better accept my shortcomings because they will help me to be better. Tests are no longer something that I worry about, because I have trained it hard from day one of each rotation. Test days are incredibly fun. Train, and train it with everything you got. Push yourself, and encourage others to push. It’s going to be hard, but it is so worth it.</p>
<p>You will gain so much by training the right mindset. Don’t be afraid to fail because you’re going to. The only difference between a master and you is that they’ve trained it in the right mindset and failed more times than you have even attempted.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Asking the question: "Are you fit to fight?" and knowing your personal fighting fitness is something you want to do before it matters. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When training for self defense many&nbsp;devote&nbsp;a lot of focus to technique. Surviving a tense situation requires repetition until you achieve perfection. But when the situation goes beyond your fighting fitness, techniques become sloppy, slower, and the danger level rises with each passing moment.&nbsp;Asking the question: &#8220;Are you fit to fight?&#8221; and knowing your personal fighting fitness is something you want to do <em>before</em> it matters.</p>
<p>There is a reason that professional MMA fighters are so dangerous. It&#8217;s not just their technique and skill, but they are athletes in every sense of the word. They push themselves to their physical limits every day of training to prepare for their matches. Obviously, most people don&#8217;t have the time to devote to the same regiment as an athlete. Fitting in training time for self defense techniques is a challenge. Take into account&nbsp;families, work, and any other activities, and you begin to see the problem. Still,&nbsp;when dealing with an attacker, remember that he or she may not be alone. Will your training last you past the first attacker, on to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th? What if you must carry an injured friend to safety? You want to ask these type of questions early to bring some reality into your training.</p>
<h2>Building Fighting Fitness into TraIning</h2>
<p>At <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com">Sifu Och Wing Chun</a>, we build some of the fitness needed for scenarios like this&nbsp;right&nbsp;into our&nbsp;actual training. But to compliment the Wing Chun, Sifu Och includes a HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) regiment within his schedule just before his <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/classes/lakeland-kickboxing-weight-loss-bootcamp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kickboxing class</a> to maximize cardio. Once students have pushed themselves to their limit, they can then&nbsp;begin increasing their cardio within the Wing Chun training. You cannot initiate hypertrophy in a muscle by going to its limit and stopping. You actually need to&nbsp;overload the muscle <em>past</em> its limit to get&nbsp;growth. The same goes for cardio. You want to take your training&nbsp;to the limit, and then push through that to increase the endurance capacity.</p>
<p>If a student is sparring, and they reach their cardio limit,&nbsp;it begins to manifest itself in weaker strikes and slower reaction time. In a situation hinging on split-second decisions, there&#8217;s no room for errors. One second could make the difference between life or death. Your fighting&nbsp;fitness level is your gas tank. The bigger the gas tank, the longer the drive. Without gas, your car goes nowhere. Without adequate fighting fitness, you go nowhere&#8230;.Fast.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>How aware are you? It just could be the difference between life or death for you or your loved ones! This is where the rubber meets the road.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wing Chun, Tae Kwon Do, Hapkido, Boxing, Karate, Judo&#8230;it doesn&#8217;t matter what you do. There&nbsp;is the one thing that will determine&nbsp;a martial artist&#8217;s ultimate demise. If proper respect and attention is not devoting to maintaining&nbsp;this one thing properly, it can demolish any training no matter the level. This may come as a surprise to many, but this is not an external attack. Rather, it&#8217;s a defeat that occurs within oneself. It&#8217;s what we call your level of martial arts awareness.</p>
<p>Awareness is the first&nbsp;key to any situation where conflict can arise. Whether in a sports arena, on your way to your car, or in a busy subway, an attacker can defeat the greatest practitioner of any art if they are not aware of their surroundings. As a martial artist, learning to be aware of all of your surroundings is key. Also, learning to have awareness of specific attacks from an opponent is also crucial in overcoming a situation. By neglecting to develop your awareness you leave yourself open to anything, anyone, at anytime. But there are two kinds of awareness alluded to, lets call them single awareness and broad awareness.</p>
<p>Single awareness here, refers to having altercation with an individual in something like a sports arena. This would be in the realm of sparring or cage fighting, facing off with one person at a time. The crucial awareness here involves&nbsp;focusing more watching the fighter&#8217;s movements <em>as a whole</em>. If you put&nbsp;too much focus on his eyes, for example, you will not see his kicks or knees. If you place&nbsp;too much focus on his legs and take downs, you may not see his strikes. Therefore, by having a balanced focus, you gain awareness of the big picture. Practically speaking, the ideal location to watch is the chin or chest, giving you that balance to catch everything. Fighting with blinders on is the fastest way to get knocked out.</p>
<h2>Moving to Broader Martial Arts Awareness</h2>
<p>Moving onto broad awareness and why it is so important outside of the cage or ring. When crossing the road, we are all taught to stop, look, and listen for oncoming traffic. Why should your personal safety from the threat of a mugger or robber be any different? The Navy Seals utilize a checklist to make sure that they are operating with full awareness in any situation. Their checklist is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attempt to guess what individuals are doing or thinking.</li>
<li>Watch for odd behavior.</li>
<li>Determine where you would go for cover from explosions or gun fire.</li>
<li>Find the closest two exits.</li>
<li>Determine whether or not someone is following you or taking an unusual interest in you.</li>
</ol>
<p>These tips become&nbsp;very hard to accomplish if you focus in on any one specific thing. That includes looking at your phone, the ground, or even your friend. Learning to take in your entire surroundings while picking up specific details is a hard skill to acquire. But without it, the danger of threat grows exponentially.</p>
<p>Sifu Och trains his student&#8217;s against worst case scenarios: Head-locks, chokes from behind, bear-hugs, etc. But, to avoid these scenarios altogether is much more advantageous than having to deal with them. You cannot utilize the checklist mentioned above if you&#8217;re not actively choosing to be attentive to your surroundings. Be aware of your surroundings, and&nbsp;be alert&nbsp;and&nbsp;ready. In short, practice and hone your martial arts awareness.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are all kinds of martial arts instructors out there running all types of martial arts schools. Some teachers are well intended but poorly trained. Others are very skilled martial artists, but they don&#8217;t have the knack for teaching. Still others are simply out there to push their students through the belt or sash system. Their goal is to&nbsp;make as much money off of those students as they can.&nbsp;So, is your sifu a fraud or the real deal? Read on to find out.</p>
<p>How exactly can you tell&nbsp;if your martial arts instructor is the real deal? While no one is perfect, there are characteristics you should identify&nbsp;in the person to whom you&#8217;re going to entrust your martial arts training. There are things you should look for and things you should avoid. I happened to find all the right qualities in Sifu (teacher, master, mentor) Justin Och and hope this article will help you find a true master for yourself.</p>
<h2>Is Your Sifu a Fraud? Check Their Credentials!</h2>
<p>Are they in a Hall of Fame? Great, but remember most hall of fames are businesses that you can write in what you get and pay them for the award and banquet. Sure, you dressed up, met a bunch of famous people, and&nbsp;took some photos. That doesn’t make you a Sifu.</p>
<p>Look for the certifications that your sifu has earned. Also, how did they earn it? Was it a weekend training course? How would you know? Was their main instructor from outside the country? If so, how did they truly learn the entire system from them? It could be likely they have only been to seminars with this person and done mostly DVD or distance training. How did they train with them if their instructor wasn&#8217;t accessible. It takes&nbsp;years of daily, hands-on attention in order&nbsp;to become a sifu. This is a warning sign that the certifications are less than genuine.</p>
<p>Remember, unlike many other systems of martial arts, Wing Chun needs one on one, personal instruction with an upper level master&nbsp;to become better in the finer aspects and details of the system. So what level of understanding and capability does&nbsp;your instructor have compared to others&nbsp;in the USA&nbsp;or other countries?</p>
<p>Training overseas or away from home is amazing and can improve&nbsp;your ability, but <em>claiming certification</em> from someone in another country is a red flag you should watch out for.</p>
<p>Instructors claiming they trained with “so and so” for years but who only have a photo of them standing next to their teacher sitting on a chair, may not be genuine sifus. Look for photos of your instructor in their youth training with the same teacher they claim, and then photos or video of them being older and doing the training. Without REAL (time-spanning) training photos or videos of them over time…well, this is possibly not a genuine instructor.</p>
<p><em>“But, Sifu is my friend and he is nice to me!”</em> We&#8217;ve heard this before, but being nice to you or being your friend doesn’t make them a sifu or a good instructor.</p>
<h2>Trust, But Verify</h2>
<p>Check their claims. Stop believing things just because people have told you. If a person tells you they had cage fighting experience, look online and type in their name and check for records, photos and video. If you&nbsp;can’t find it, then they might not be a genuine instructor. If they told you they have a purple belt in Brazilian Jiujitsu, but you can’t find any evidence online or otherwise&nbsp;(and the person’s name doesn’t really exist or is unreachable), they might not be a genuine instructor.</p>
<p>Most genuine sifus had to train for a multitude of years one on one and are going to proudly display their certifications and awards in their studio so they can be viewed by their students. Look around. Check out their website. Does he or she say she is certified at all? If so, in what are they certified? Who certified them—and is that organization reputable? Are those certifying&nbsp;organizations huge with hundreds of instructors under one teacher that resides in another country? If so, this could point to the fact that you are not in the presence of a genuine sifu with full training under their sash.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Remember there are some fantastic instructors out there that aren’t sifus and can give you a ton of information and make you into a fantastic Wing Chun Kung Fu practitioner. But you should&nbsp;look around, check out different schools, and separate the great ones from the mediocre.</p>
<p>A great instructor doesn’t have to be a sifu, or have a amazing lineage to show you. But how would you know the great instructors from the frauds unless you understand how to tell&nbsp;the difference?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the age of the Internet, everything is now held to a higher standard due to the easy access to information. Martial arts can now be scrutinized from someone across the globe that 100 years ago may never even have come in contact with them before. With videos alone, information can be cross-referenced and discussed with the click of a button. But, does that mean research can replace real life experience? Absolutely not. Do videos posted speak for all such martial arts and artists across the world? Again, absolutely not. So, with today&#8217;s digital world, can Wing Chun be accurately depicted on the web? Can the question <em>Does Wing Chun actually work?</em> be answered without experiencing it?</p>
<p>The answer to the question is&nbsp;that&nbsp;it&#8217;s irrelevant. A system that is used to defend oneself on the street should not be evaluated via the Internet. Any martial art (or instructor), whether it be Karate, Krav Maga, Brazilian Jui-Jitsu, or Tae Kwon do, should not be criticized via the web. When it comes to personal safety, only experience can truly speak. Can the Internet help? Absolutely—but it should not be your determining factor.</p>
<h2>Making Decisions Based on Online Research</h2>
<p>The reason the Internet was brought up in a discussion about whether or not Wing Chun actually works is due to the fact that so many people will make potentially life-changing decisions without actually getting their hands dirty. How can you know if something actually works without seeing it for yourself! Speaking to&nbsp;<a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/instructors">Wing Chun&nbsp;instructors</a> in depth and hearing their story? You might as well determine whether or not YOU like Subway or 5 Guys because of what someone on the Internet said. Now, information does need to be taken into account, but you cannot let someone else&#8217;s experience—good or bad—determine your decision. But allow the information to help you keep an open mind to the good and bad, raising your level of awareness.</p>
<p>When testing a martial art you should by all means do your research. Go and meet the instructor. Watch his students, and then TRY IT! As far as Wing Chun is concerned, it absolutely works. Two of Sifu Justin Och&#8217;s top students are a testament to that. <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/instructors/sihing-garret-brumfield-2nd-level-wing-chun-instructor/">Garret Brumfield</a> is an ex-professional Boxer out of California and <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/instructors/sihing-jeff-gardner-2nd-level-wing-chun-instructor/">Jeff Gardner</a> was an Army Ranger widely versed in many martial arts prior to Wing Chun. The fact that two <em>experienced</em>, well-trained men now adhere to Sifu Och&#8217;s instruction is a huge testament not only the system, but to Sifu Och himself.</p>
<p>That being said, the system works, but does your instructor? There are many effective, brutal, powerful systems of combat out there. That doesn&#8217;t mean that every instructor either knows or understands how to effectively teach that system. That is where your research comes in. Check your instructor&#8217;s lineage, and watch his students. Those will be two determining indicators of a good teacher. As for Wing Chun, good instructors are hard to find. This is mainly due to the commercialized versions that are now popular after the release of the <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/ip-man/"><em>Ip Man</em></a> movies. These were movies loosely based on the teacher of <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/bruce-lee-and-jeet-kune/">Bruce Lee</a>, Ip Man. Many &#8220;Sifus&#8221; began to emerge and teach the &#8220;real&#8221; Wing Chun. The Internet soon caught on, and many videos surfaced of Wing Chun students losing fights to Muai Thai, Karate, and Brasilian Jui-Jitsu Fighters. Faith in Wing Chun was weakened. There are, however, <em>real</em>&nbsp;Wing Chun instructors who&nbsp;understand the system and communicate it well. Sifu Philip Bayer, Sifu David Peterson, and Sifu Justin Och are just a few of the truly knowledgable&nbsp;instructors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Doing anything with two hands is always better than one! Ever tried opening a jar? How about moving some furniture? Want to talk about safety? Everyone is taught to drive with two hands! Of course these tasks can be completed with some degree of success with one hand. But utilizing two hands doubles the effectiveness of that task. It&#8217;s the same with fighting, and yet many popular striking styles seem to shy away from simultaneous hand techniques. Believe me when I say, two hands are better than one in self defense.</p>
<h2>Why Two Hands are Better Than One</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at two of the most popular and widespread styles of striking in America: Boxing and karate. Boxing (also called pugilism, meaning &#8220;fist fight&#8221;) was a sport dating as far back as 4,000 B.C. in ancient Africa. Karate is a self defense system that originated in Okinawa, Japan. Karate has become increasingly adapted for sport use as well. Both systems, for the most part, strike with one hand at a time. Karate has a few exceptions, but we&#8217;ll stay with general concepts here. Boxing uses the non-striking hand to keep the body covered while Karate&#8217;s chambering hand is prepping for power maximization. Karate does have other uses for the chambering hand (one being to pull the opponents hand down to clear for easy striking). Primarily, however, striking occurs&nbsp;with only one hand. In karate, the goal is to have as much power as possible focused into those strikes and to end the fight quickly.</p>
<h2>The Wing Chun Two Hands Option</h2>
<p>To achieve this maximum power, both systems start on their toes, connect to their hips, and rotate through the striking arm. However, if one could block and attack at the same time—and have enough power to knock someone out—would that not be more advantageous? As <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/instructors/sifu-justin-och-chief-wing-chun-instructor/">Master Sifu Och</a> puts it, &#8220;Why pull away half your army when you can utilize all of it?&#8221;. Wing Chun seeks to demonstrate why two hands are better than one in martial arts. Wing Chun uses both hands (and sometimes a foot) as a single unit. This is achieved by driving the power from the heels and propelling the entire body forward as one cohesive unit. Instead of rotating the hips away, as in boxing, Wing Chun keeps both hips facing forward. With both hips engaged, both hands can now be activated simultaneously. With two hands going forward, opponents can now be blocked and attacked at the same with every strike.</p>
<p>Here is a video of Sifu Justin Och demonstrating the use of two hands in a practical self defense scenario:</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Sifu Och Lakeland Florida Wing Chun - Reaction scenario" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r4ErO0VbtZ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In the video you can see how two hands allows the practitioner to double the effectiveness of his striking. When this happens, you have doubled your chances for effectively dissolving or resolving the situation. In an altercation every advantage is needed. If you&#8217;re facing one opponent—or two or six—every second is precious. By utilizing two hands, you gain valuable seconds by cutting out the time needed to alternate between strikes.</p>
<p>Two hands are truly better than one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some are concerned about how our society is getting rougher, and situations may arise where you need to engage in self defense to protect yourself or your family. If you&#8217;re interested or involved in martial arts for self defense, studying Wing Chun gives you skills for both self-protection and general physical fitness. It&#8217;s not that this craft is all about battling; but when we&#8217;re asked the question: Is Wing Chun Beginner Kung Fu? we have to honestly answer—absolutely not! While Wing Chun is accessible, the genuine craft of Wing Chun is to study &#8216;The Way of Life&#8217;. In short, if you want to excel in Wing Chun, you&#8217;re in for the long haul.</p>
<p>Is Wing Chun great for physical exercise? Yes. Is it attainable to study at both young and old ages? Absolutely. But is Wing Chun beginner kung fu? No, because it&#8217;s flexible and extensible enough to produce amazing, real-world combative techniques and results.</p>
<p>Give me an opportunity to acquaint you with why you hear the phrase Wing Chun Beginner Kung-Fu &#8211; it&#8217;s simply an excellent style to jump into at any stage. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re interested in <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/prevent-bullying/">kids kung fu</a> to help with your child deal with bullying in a mature manner or you have experience and want <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/classes/advanced-wing-chun-classes/">advanced Wing Chun training</a>, thus form can always advance you further. The Wing Chun style is possibly the best you can study. We like to say that it &#8220;joins the Yin &amp; Yang together&#8221; to help you cut your adversary down from close quarters as fast as you can. Wing Chun is a close-range fighting system, made for self-preservation in the city to help a smaller, and potentially weaker, individual successfully combat a stronger, larger attacker. This style doesn&#8217;t use any ornate or fancy movements, just the most economic. Frequently, Wing Chun style takes the straightest way to the target, breaking the adversary&#8217;s structure as fast as can reasonably be expected. Mastering Wing Chun can help you overcome dangerous situations peacefully as well as shrewdly. Even a&nbsp;Wing Chun beginner&nbsp;begins to&nbsp;find useful and practical applications within a few classes.</p>
<h2><b>After Studying Multiple Forms, Wing Chun covered everything</b></h2>
<p>Throughout my 16 years of preparing and instructing Wing Chun&nbsp;Beginner Kung-Fu, I considered Wing Chun, in my notion, covers everything that I need; Self-Defense&nbsp; due to which I am able to adapt to any issues in the city, Chi-Kung that is the usage of Inner Energy to enhance my health, mental in addition to physical energy, Meditation to rewind from the daily schedule, or help with bad circulation or even bad posture, enhance my levels of serenity, sharpness and cognizance, Body Conditioning &amp; Fitness&nbsp; that is reinforce the form, to enhance fitness and stamina, pick up self-assurance, etc. The most imperative of all is self-discipline &amp; self inspiration. Let Wing Chun Kung-Fu represent itself with no issue, as this workmanship has been passed down from era to era for countless years and as of recently made numerous celebrated Grandmasters and Masters. I adore this workmanship.</p>
<p><b>New students grouped in pairs</b></p>
<p>All new students will be grouped into two and they will be trained on how to experience each other&#8217;s power gaining augmented understanding which helps students assault and defy a challenger&#8217;s movements exactly, rapidly, and relate the suitable technique to boost your pace, time, reaction and authority.&nbsp; If the adversary tries to pull out or convey the hand, the learner follows, frequently by means of the movement to help trapping in addition to striking simultaneously, ad infinitum to the rival&#8217;s weakest spots.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Travel the distance and try out our classes, there is only one way to know and that is to join.</strong></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With Wing Chun centerline theory, students focus on the hitting power, direction, and intent of their delivered blows. In this way they are visualizing the strike through the body to the vitals, organs, and spinal column. <span id="more-3373"></span>Understanding the&nbsp;Wing Chun centerline theory allows students to&nbsp;actively participate in training themselves to think critically when attacking. This focus&nbsp;includes understanding&nbsp;the amount of pressure, power, skill, and speed it will&nbsp;take to shatter, break, or destroy an opponent&#8217;s&nbsp;&#8220;core of cylindrical ice&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Penetrating the Cylindrical Core</h2>
<p>The cylindrical core is also&nbsp;your&nbsp;energy core. It&#8217;s everything from the head all the way down to the groin. By&nbsp; shattering or breaking this energy core, you can shut down an&nbsp;assailant. To practice, find something deep and solid you can visualize, and focus intently on it. Visualize the amount of resistance a cylindrical core of ice can give and the amount of power, technique and skill needed to shatter it. Once you have visualized it place deep within the body, strike at it. Striking at the surface will not affect it—strike <em>through&nbsp;</em>it. Whether you visualize that you&#8217;re striking all the way through to the spine or simply shattering ice, you must strike through the surface to the center in order to be effective.</p>
<h2>Wing Chun Centerline Theory Explained</h2>
<p>Wing Chun Centerline Theory deals with&nbsp;controlling the center which is only possible for brief moments against an advanced opponent. Opponents who are not advanced can be controlled for longer periods of time. Highly mobile assailants with advanced training and skills will try to slip, move, or pull out and attack to counter controlling movements. All aspects of Wing Chun centerline theory must work as a whole. Being taught, learning or understanding only one piece of Wing Chun is like having a car with only one gear. Any martial art can use centerline theory, but Wing Chun was created to maximize its potential.</p>
<p>Every aspect&nbsp;of Wing Chun centerline theory focuses on the best way to protect and devastate this integral part of the human condition, while&nbsp;controlling all aspects of the body in a fight. Every attack and defense radiates from this center. To control it is to control every action and reaction an&nbsp;opponent makes. Practicing and enhancing your&nbsp;peripheral vision will allow you to encompass not only your&nbsp;opponent&#8217;s body, but also any additional opponents that may decide to join a&nbsp;fight. A good centerline keeps your&nbsp;back straight,&nbsp;the head is slightly down, and the knees always bent to strike, move, and redirect incoming attacks.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t try to watch an&nbsp;assailant&#8217;s eyes, hands, or legs. Rather, look at the center chest and allow your peripheral vision to take in the rest of your surroundings. Always keep your hands in front of you—this gives you&nbsp;a reference point for your vision. You&nbsp;can actually calculate the distance and speed of your assailant&#8217;s attacks based off of their distance and movement in reference to the length of your arms from your body.</p>
<h2>Centerline Theory for Practical Protection and Defense</h2>
<p>Placing your hands in an active forward protecting position psychologically forces&nbsp;an assailant to attack from the outside—the center is already occupied by your arms. Any time you can force&nbsp;an assailant to take the longer route to their intended destination you win. A&nbsp;Wing Chun practitioner will always seek to travel directly through the center.&nbsp; Using this tactic, you can start to practice centerline theory, control, movement, protection, and devastation.</p>
<p>Remember, an&nbsp;assailant has to attack your centerline in order to harm you. Attacking your shoulder, arms, and legs will only cause minimal damage unless left unchecked. Any effective punch, kick, or body attack from an&nbsp;assailant goes for your center.&nbsp; This is the only way to engage and shut you down quickly in a fight.&nbsp; Any other attack, whether grabbing, pulling, Chi Na, or a take down will need more than a single motion to shut you down. Any attacks that cause immediate shutdown are on the centerline.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b></b>Wing Chun Kung Fu is a war-like art as well as a combat system born in Southern China. While this art was planned by a woman and is actually aimed for small people to attack larger&nbsp;people, building striking power is quite important to be effective. Apart from strengthening muscles as well as making one effective&nbsp;using normal body weight, this &#8220;warfare sport&#8221; inculcates precious skillfulness in children which can be applied all throughout one’s life. Building power to effectively manage a confrontation is imperative in progressing in Wing Chun Kung Fu.</p>
<h2>Building Striking Power to Enhance Balance and Eye-hand Coordination</h2>
<p>You can&nbsp;quickly build&nbsp;up balance&nbsp;and eye-hand&nbsp;coordination by practicing kata—otherwise known as Kung Fu kicks. This conventional kung fu practice focuses on flexibility and stretching (also good for holistic muscle development). It also serves to build striking power—even when practiced at a young age.</p>
<h2>It Takes Time to Build Striking&nbsp;Power</h2>
<p>Building striking power takes&nbsp;time, but not as much as you may think. Building power to&nbsp;oppose&nbsp;another&#8217;s force during a&nbsp;confrontation can be done by practicing with an opponent.&nbsp;While this assumes the lively application of training with an partner—you can also train&nbsp;your&nbsp;body through&nbsp;resistance training with objects, training your&nbsp;muscles&nbsp;with&nbsp;free weights or body weight exercises. You can employ hanging bags, speed bags, rice bags, wooden dummies, focus mitts, and anything else that builds knockout power from repetitive&nbsp;blows.</p>
<p>You can further build striking power by doing&nbsp;pushups, or even striking one thousand times a day at a focus mitt. Make use of anything and everything that is accessible so as to build your muscles as well as your endurance.&nbsp;Nothing is useless&nbsp;as long as it can be&nbsp;used to build striking power. Try your hands at lifting or even benching for focused periods of&nbsp;time. This type of exercising will prove to be very useful later on when you start combating in Wing Chun Kung Fu. Bear in mind that, in terms of effectiveness, using a 25 lb weight in both hands and punching fifty times will not be as&nbsp;useful as&nbsp;punching 1000 times with 5-8 lb weights in each hand.</p>
<h2>Using a Partner</h2>
<p>Finally your power build-up will be best built-up when using a partner. Remember—you may have power, but it will prove to be useless if you are not able to land the hit in the right place. Use a partner, and your training will be increased exponentially.</p>
<h2>Knockout Power</h2>
<p>Whenever you practice for control, velocity, endurance, intention as well as accuracy,&nbsp;knockout power is created. The ability to deliver power as a steady flow lets you execute and release a&nbsp;perfect&nbsp;build up of power against an opponent. Working towards a flawless&nbsp;execution style&nbsp;isn&#8217;t enough.&nbsp;Aptness of speed with a&nbsp;deficiency of power&nbsp;means that even if&nbsp;you hit a person with a hundred chain punches&nbsp;it will be&nbsp;devoid of power. You punches will simply &#8220;tail off&#8221;. Conversely, raw&nbsp;power will also not result&nbsp;in fully&nbsp;useful strikes unless&nbsp;coupled&nbsp;with proper&nbsp;velocity, control, accuracy, precision, and aim.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span style="font-size: 13px;">We all live in a less than ideal world. In street fighting Wing Chun techniques seek to diffuse the advantage of an&nbsp;opponent (or opponents). Fights should be the last resort to resolving any&nbsp;conflict, but unfortunately, we may find ourselves in a situation where we have to fight. Street fighting is the most common situation you&#8217;ll find yourself in, and without any training, it&#8217;s not easy to escape without some&nbsp;injuries.</span></p>
<p>At Sifu Och Wing Chun, you learn traditional Wing Chun. But what a lot of people may not know is that there are specialized courses, which teach you to fight in the modern world. With street fighting Wing Chun is one of the more practical techniques that seeks to diffuse the advantage of any&nbsp;opponents &#8211; big or small. The&nbsp;Sifu Och&nbsp;Wing Chun Kung Fu style teaches techniques&nbsp;that you can implement in the modern world.</p>
<p>Our Wing Chun <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/self-defense-2/">real world self defense</a> classes and <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/classes/advanced-wing-chun-classes/">Advanced Wing Chun classes</a>&nbsp;are&nbsp;courses designed for all ages. In fact, we wish (and even&nbsp;recommended) that Polk County schools teach parts of this course to students, getting them started at an early age. With street fighting, Wing Chun techniques work&nbsp;to diffuse the advantage of the opponents. While there are certainly instant advantages, trained over time, these techniques can have a real impact in the lives of your&nbsp;children.</p>
<h2>Common Mistakes Made in Street Fighting</h2>
<p>There are few big mistakes that people often make in street fighting. We teach our kids and adults&nbsp;to avoid these&nbsp;in our Sifu Och&nbsp;<a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/classes/wing-chun-lakeland-florida/">Wing Chun Kung Fu classes</a>. It has saved many a kid from getting seriously injured. In particular,&nbsp;the face is the most susceptible region for any person. Wen street fighting, people don&#8217;t protect their face &#8211; and get hurt quickly as a result. Wing Chun Kung Fu techniques seek to diffuse any&nbsp;advantage of an&nbsp;opponents while protecting the face and neck. A hit to the neck, eye or nose, can cause serious damage, or at least cause you to stagger and/or fall. In a street fight a&nbsp;fall can result in more injuries &#8211; for one, your&nbsp;head could bang against something hard, or your attcker could decide to continue the fight when you&#8217;re on the ground.</p>
<h2>Sifu Och&nbsp;Wing Chun Teaches Real World&nbsp;Self Defense Techniques</h2>
<p>The real world techniques taught by Sifu Och Wing Chun involve&nbsp;sparring with a live opponent, using constant-forward force. This more closely simulates street fighting as opposed to drilling alone. When you can&#8217;t have a live opponent we also tech you how to practice solo and continue your training on your own when class isn&#8217;t in session. Our Wing Chun practice techniques also utilize&nbsp;a wooden dummy and practices called “Chi Sau” or “Sticky Hands” meant solely for this purpose.</p>
<p>Even if an&nbsp;opponent is bigger and more muscular, they should not have a significant advantage with someone well-trained in Wing Chun. The force for sparring and attacks come from distinct stances taught in Wing Chun. Those with smaller stature&nbsp;can easily counter much bigger assailants and escape with little harm.</p>
<p>Wing Chun does not train to fight only with honor, it trains to fight when required and escape.Street fighting Wing Chun techniques seek to diffuse the advantage of the opponents. The idea is to incur the least amount of damage. This is the truth of street fights. Rarely are street fights about honor. They are mostly about people ganging up.</p>
<p>Kids and bullies in the schools of Polk County, like most other schools, generally rely on the pack mentality, to harass or attack someone. Critical blows can lead to the hospitalization of the child.</p>
<p>The techniques taught by Wing Chun Kung Fu academy can help to avoid such injuries.Street fighting Wing Chun techniques seek to diffuse the advantage of the opponents. Special courses for kids in schools of Polk County are provided, under the banner of Sifu Och Wing Chun to fight in street fights, and against difficult odds.</p>
<p>Enroll your child in a course. Attend the some sessions at the Academy free of cost.Street fighting Wing Chun techniques seek to diffuse the advantage of the opponents. The accomplished teachers at the Wing Chun Kung Fu academy will be more than happy to guide with personalised training.&nbsp;<em> &#8211; by Wing Chun fans of Sifu Justin Och</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Remember, aggression knows no age, colour or sex. Small street fights can end with dire consequences. Act today to avoid such situations.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you look up &#8220;combative&#8221; in&nbsp;Wikipedia, you get the following definition:&nbsp;“the United States Army&#8217;s term for hand-to-hand combat training and techniques”.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a term that stems out of World War I and is now widely used in most close quarter fighting techniques. For Wing Chun combative training, we&#8217;re really differentiating the fact that our <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/classes/wing-chun-lakeland-florida/">Wing Chun classes</a> can and will train you to engage an attacker using aggressive self-defense techniques that will quickly end an altercation or assault.</p>
<p>Brutal combatives are the escalation of combatives that have one objective—to incapacitate your opponent quickly and effectively. Such fierce training can only be learned in the company of masters. Lakeland Wing Chun combative&nbsp;is a collection of training programs meant to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Wing Chun, as a branch of Kung Fu,&nbsp;is among the Traditional Martial Arts (TMA) that sought to mold Kung Fu into an aggressive form. Kung Fu was initially conceived as more <em>defensive</em> than offensive.</p>
<p>When fighting in close quarters, and in disadvantaged positions, many practitioners over the years felt that a&nbsp;more&nbsp;aggressive approach was required to get out of a&nbsp;situation. Wing Chun Kung Fu trains a common person to be able to fight quickly and, yes, brutally. Our Lakeland Wing Chun combative classes and techniques are&nbsp;a carefully designed model that allows people of all ages to come and train together effectively.</p>
<p>With&nbsp;Sifu Och&nbsp;Wing Chun combative training, you&#8217;re given&nbsp;personalized advice. People of different ages, physical conditions, and goals, all come to train under the single banner of Wing Wing Chun combative.&nbsp;Our Sifu Och Wing Chun combative training includes&nbsp;a collection of courses. They&#8217;re targeted at varying physiques and ages. There is, for example, a distinct training that involves hand-to-hand training. Yet another training regimen is dedicated&nbsp;to honing your kicking techniques.</p>
<p>In all honesty, we&#8217;re hardly the mirror image of Bruce Lee, who made Kung Fu famous. We&#8217;re also unlikely to go up against some &#8220;evil warlord&#8221; in martial arts games. In all likelihood, we&#8217;re more apt&nbsp;to find ourselves in a street fight. This maybe to ward off an assailant or even thwart an assault.</p>
<p>Real life training is what&#8217;s essentially provided for exactly such situations under the Sifu Och&nbsp;Wing Chun brutal combatives banner. The idea of Wing Chun combative is to use your techniques and quickly incapacitate or disorient the assailant, thus giving you enough time to escape to safety.</p>
<p>Of course, if you&#8217;re a martial arts fan, you want to train with the best. You will find the most accomplished trainers&nbsp;at Sifu Och&nbsp;Wing Chun. The best part is that you don&#8217;t just meet the Sifu at some high level course only. Rather, your training—no matter at what level—is <em>personally</em> supervised by <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/about-sifu-och-wing-chun/dr-sifu-justin-och-biography/">Sifu Justin Och</a>. Personal attention is an every day thing for the Lakeland Wing Chun school in downtown.</p>
<p>Learning Wing Chun will require at least six months of practice before you can see and feel some results, just like learning to play the piano or learning a new language. Sifu Och&nbsp;Wing Chun combative is a modern series of effective&nbsp;requirements meant to produce quick and targeted results.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you in or out of range?&nbsp;When training in&nbsp;Wing Chun you should never&nbsp;stay in mid-range during a fight. Mid-range is where both you and the assailant can strike, punch and kick at&nbsp;each other. Let&#8217;s put it this way—why would want to exchange blows or have your&nbsp;assailant be at <em>their</em> optimum when attacking? You wouldn&#8217;t. Wing Chun&#8217;s specialty is <em>close</em>-range combat. Your fighting ranges need to be tight to optimize all that Wing Chun has to offer. Because of this, you should either close the distance to be on the inside of &#8220;in-fighting&#8221; or stay out of the assailant&#8217;s range of attack. Maintaining correct fighting ranges in <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/lakeland-wing-chun-combative/">Wing Chun combative</a> causes many great opportunities as the assailant is forced to fight on <em>your</em> timing. Making sure you&#8217;re in-range for fighting, but out of range to your opponent&#8217;s&nbsp;blows is key. As the assailant attempts to close distance, you want to close—just as quickly as you can. They will end up overshooting their intended&nbsp;target.</p>
<p>This overshoot of the assailant creates a close quarter combat situation which is ideal for the Wing Chun practitioner.&nbsp; If the assailant decides to back up and create distance then the Wing Chun practitioner will attempt to destroy and cause damage to every limb thrown at them by the assailant by means of attack. After causing damage a Wing Chun practitioner will then close distance and &#8220;eat&#8221; their way into the assailant&#8217;s centerline vitals.</p>
<p>Some assailant&#8217;s—if knowledgeable about your skills—will keep backing up and will rarely attempt to throw strikes so that they do not get damaged. These assailant are attempting to escape your attacks and create their own timing. Don&#8217;t let this happen.&nbsp;Any control of any aspect of the fight is crucial to keeping the Wing Chun practitioner as safe as possible and maximizing the damage to the assailant. Very fast low to medium long range kicks to the ribs, organs, groin, ephemeral arteries and knee&#8217;s are employed to cause damage and hesitation in the assailants movements. This hesitation or&nbsp;pause is all a Wing Chun practitioner needs to take back control.</p>
<h2>Close Quarter Fighting Ranges in&nbsp;Combat with Wing Chun</h2>
<blockquote><p>Never stay in mid-range. It&#8217;s purposeless. Instead, bait, time, and trap the assailant using close-quarter in-fighting combinations that trap, redirect, and allow you to end the fight decisively.</p></blockquote>
<p>When the fight is no longer close-range make your assailant pay dearly for drawing out the fight by destroy and striking at areas that will cause the maximum amount of pain while maintaining the height of your defensive and offensive Wing Chun tactics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b></b>No one can argue that Bruce Lee possessed a powerful and muscular physique. Along with that, most people admire him because of the fighting styles he has shown—both in movies and in real life. Like so many martial artists, Bruce Lee trained in boxing, jujitsu, karate, judo and Greco-roman wrestling just to name a few. The most popular fighting style he used for his demonstrations of street fighting, however, was&nbsp;Wing Chun. Fortunately, you don&#8217;t have to be Bruce Lee to win a street fight using Wing Chun Kung Fu.</p>
<p>Originating from the Shaolin monks of China, Wing Chun is a hard-hitting combat fighting style where the goal is to take the opponent down as quickly as possible. To win a street fight using Wing Chun you have to train, push, and gain real ability to protect yourself and your loved ones. To compare Wing Chun with other types of martial arts, you see that&nbsp;the idea behind Wing Chun is to attack the center portion of the body while striking the vital areas. This breaks the opponent’s balance. To win a&nbsp;street fight using Wing Chun you learn to&nbsp;absorb strikes, which deflects an&nbsp;attacker’s energy.</p>
<h2><b>Hand Movements</b></h2>
<p>Most martial arts teach individuals two movements: the offense and the defense. However, Sifu Och&nbsp;Wing Chun&nbsp;(and indeed, Wing Chun in general) combines&nbsp;these two movements&nbsp;into one. That means you can block attacks <em>and</em> strike at your opponent at the same time. Unlike boxing, however, the strike doesn’t have to involve more power—although you can do real damage if everything is done correctly. In general, to win a street fight using Wing Chun you need&nbsp;to perfect and grow your speed, balance, technique, and efficiency.</p>
<h2><b>Weapons</b></h2>
<p>More of manual combative technique, Wing Chun instructors can also teach their students to&nbsp;handle traditional weapons such as the dragon pole and the butterfly knives. These weapons could seriously hack down an opponent, so&nbsp;in the training session a wooden dummy is used to boost strength during actual combat.</p>
<h2><b>Win a Street Fight Using Wing Chun in Actual Combat</b></h2>
<p>Mastering the principles of Wing Chun takes time, but it&#8217;s&nbsp;a powerful self-defense system when learned correctly and practiced in depth. When perfected, Wing Chun&nbsp;can be used effectively to defeat a much larger opponent. There is no time limit in an actual street&nbsp;fight,&nbsp;but you can’t exactly tell an&nbsp;attacker to &#8220;wait for a minute&#8221; because you’re tired. The more prepared and fit you are, the better you&#8217;ll fare.&nbsp;As a form of self-defense, wining a street fight using Wing Chun is absolutely likely—particularly with its techniques to end an encounter quickly and effectively.&nbsp;Most street fights only last a short period of time. As a street fighter, it is important to be familiar with different martial arts like Wing Chun.</p>
<p>To sum it all&nbsp;up, learning Wing Chun fro Sifu Och requires both&nbsp;effort and determination. Yet, the highest degree of&nbsp;learning can be achieved through the careful tutelage of&nbsp;a professional Wing Chun instructor. It was way back in the 1950s when the modernization of this martial art has begun to earn popularity&#8230;and it continues to grow in both popularity and recognition.</p>
<p>Today, Wing Chun practitioners can be seen all over the world. Even in the United States, and particularly in Florida, there are schools like Sifu Och Wing Chun that accept students who are willing to learn this type of self-defense. If you are live&nbsp;in the central Florida, Sifu Och Wing Chun in Lakeland FL may be&nbsp;the best and most accessible option for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b></b>Every classic and modern combat system is based in science. It may not be up-front and obvious, but all fighting styles utilize movements, systems, and methodologies that can be broken down into force, leverage, inertia, angles, and power. If that&#8217;s not science—well, we don&#8217;t know what is. So it makes perfect sense that we&#8217;d want to break down the science of Wing Chun to see what exactly is going on when you throw a tan zhao punch or counter an opponent&#8217;s leg. Wing Chun is most certainly&nbsp;a realistic as well as scientific arrangement of combat. So&nbsp;how much of science does Wing Chun contain?</p>
<h2><b>How scientific is Wing Chun Self Defense</b></h2>
<p>From the human anatomy point of view, Wing Chun observes that the groin, throat, eyes and many of our other key susceptible targets all perch down the centerline of our body. Due to this and several other causes we invariably assault and oppose all attacks along the middle.</p>
<h3><b>Follows Geometry axiom</b></h3>
<p>An adage in geometry states “the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.” &nbsp;It&#8217;s for exactly this reason that Wing Chun practitioners forever strike as well as defend directly in front of, and all along, the center. As an alternative of parrying first and then striking back, a Wing Chun student will concurrently block as well as a hit—even when&nbsp;the opponent&nbsp;is mid-strike.</p>
<h2><b>Physics in wing chun self defense<br />
</b></h2>
<p>A law&nbsp;of physics states that&nbsp;&#8220;two objects cannot occupy the same space at the same time.&#8221;&nbsp;With this in mind, the science&nbsp;of Wing Chun self defense, at all times, aims to constantly engage the center line with punches&nbsp;in addition to kicks, conceding to and redirecting all obstructions. It also&nbsp;persistently substitutes the&nbsp;arms back transversely via the center line. As soon as you&nbsp;are able to control the center in Wing Chun, you&nbsp;can feel as well as take advantage of your challenger’s under- and over-committals by means of sticky legs or hands sensitivity.</p>
<h3><b>Follows triangle or pyramid in structure</b></h3>
<p>The triangle or&nbsp;pyramid is the firmest shape in nature. Realizing this, Wing Chun frequently applies in its arrangement as well as movements&nbsp;in&nbsp;triangles in addition to 45/60 degree angles. For instance, when training, Wing Chun has you&nbsp;stand somewhat pigeon-toed with knees curved in and with both arms pulled out—creating 3 triangles by means the&nbsp;our arms, legs, and&nbsp;feet.</p>
<h3><b>45 or 60 degree angle to deflect</b></h3>
<p>When parrying or even attacking, Wing Chun&nbsp;makes use of the control of 45 or 60 degree angles to ward off, pass on and cut across an opponent&#8217;s defenses. If substantial force is aimed at at the&nbsp;centerline, then Wing Chun&nbsp;&#8220;triangle evades&#8221; and moves forward at 45/60 degrees, letting you move&nbsp;beyond your initial&nbsp;location by means of not brute power or muscle, but merely the control of angles.</p>
<h2><b>The SCIENCE OF Wing Chun IS truly a science of self-defense</b></h2>
<p>There are quite a lot of other examples in addition to the reasons why Wing Chun really is the science of self-defense. It&#8217;s sufficient to say that by taking into consideration characteristics of anatomy, geometry, kinesiology, and physics, Wing Chun self defense is more of a martial science than an art. In fact, the application (along with the workouts and training forms) is&nbsp;the &#8220;art&#8221; part of the martial art, while the &#8220;science&#8221; is subconscious in addition to second-nature, implanting the muscle-memory, memorizing to control the opponent’s power, thereby productively expressing yours.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b></b>Is Wing Chun unstoppable? Of course not—no martial arts style is perfect. On top of that, it&#8217;s not necessarily the style that wins a fight, but the dedication and fitness of the practitioner who wields it. Still, there are some Wing Chun weaknesses that we can discuss freely and with openness to the style&#8217;s apparent limitations.&nbsp;Every line of attack in Wing Chun has a minimum of four lines of weakness that the form&nbsp;uses to disrupt the&nbsp;original speed and direction. Thus,&nbsp;slap blocking or parrying an attack by pressing it inward and upward, or outward and downward, causes the assailant to lose both power and structure. This is done primarily through redirection and loss of energy. When&nbsp;a Wing Chun practitioner reacts&nbsp;correctly and quickly&nbsp;to the strike of an&nbsp;assailant, he&nbsp;no longer has to deal with the original equation of net force and vector sums in a one-directional response.</p>
<p>Wing Chun has historically, however, focused on a close-combat&nbsp;range, focused on an area between the actual striking range and a grapple. Because&nbsp;many schools fail to train using tosses and grappling during sparring—or fail to do much sparring at all—strikes&nbsp;are often trained in response to a contact initiation (someone throws a punch). Long-range fighting skills as well as ground techniques and grappling may be left untouched—at least for many years. At Sifu Och Wing Chun we combat these tendencies by emphasizing sparring, grappling, and ground techniques for all of &nbsp;our <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/classes/advanced-wing-chun-classes/">Advanced Wing Chun classes</a> and students.</p>
<p>Without sufficient training and sparring practice and techniques being mastered,&nbsp;Wing Chun&nbsp;can&nbsp;be vulnerable to less conventional fighting styles like wrestling or more common&nbsp;professional boxing. If you&#8217;re learning Wing Chun&nbsp;you simply&nbsp;<em>must</em>&nbsp;spar and ensure that you&#8217;re not simply learning programmed responses to predictable attacks. Those who fail to do so may find themselves unable to adequately defend themselves in a <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/is-wing-chun-practical-street-fights/">street fighting scenario</a>.</p>
<h2>Multiple Styles Incorporated Into Wing Chun</h2>
<p>For schools like Sifu Och Wing Chun that emphasize sparring and the integration of multiple techniques, there are less issues for those working on their techniques to develop sufficient skill and reaction time.&nbsp;Integrating techniques and styles from&nbsp;kickboxing or even MMA&nbsp;can really advance students in how to deal with non-traditional and long range attacks. Sparring against a wide range of potential styles and offensive techniques is a great way to reduce what might be considered Wing Chun weaknesses.&nbsp;When you are well-practiced and your defensive styles become natural and reflexive, you&#8217;l be in much betters ape when addressing what are otherwise considered Wing Chun weaknesses.</p>
<p>Where Wing Chun really shines is in its ability to deflect stronger attacks with both precision and speed.&nbsp;If, for example, a truck tries to derail a train by driving directly down the track, it loses. This is because it has to deal with the full momentum and force of not only the fist or front of the train but every “cargo section” that has built speed, weight and momentum behind it. A&nbsp;truck striking the side of a train has a much greater chance of derailing the intended target as it only deals with a small portion of the overall power and momentum built within the vehicle.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Another example is attacking the opponent&#8217;s attack.&nbsp; This can be done in multiple ways.&nbsp; Using the intercepting fist or turning punch, and striking or hitting the opponent&#8217;s strike from an outside angle.&nbsp; Though the assailant may strike first, your angled deflection takes an inward and upward angle that meets only a fraction of its energy, to divert its intended destination point. </i></p></blockquote>
<p>This first uses “live hand” which is using your arm on top of the opponent&#8217;s. As the opponent punches, you punch at their centerline, staying on top of your opponent&#8217;s punch, while keeping your elbow slightly bent, thus redirecting their strike as you hit their center.&nbsp; This allows you to strike last but arrive first, with your assailant&#8217;s attempt redirected and your strike reaching its intended target, by blocking and attacking simultaneously.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Other examples of this type of redirection are the Jum Sau, also known as forearm block, Biu Gee, also known as thrusting fingers which can block and slip in an attack at the same time by keeping the fingers and arm forward and the elbow slightly down. A Bong Sau, also known as a wing arm block, that uses the angle of the forearm and the height of the elbow and shifting to redirect the opponents attack upward or to the side.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Want to eliminate the potential weakness of Wing Chun? Practice against multiple techniques, drill to perfection, and ensure you&#8217;re engaging in real sparring that exposes you to non-traditional attack methods.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b></b>Sadly, there have been several recent reports&nbsp;of&nbsp;various attackers fighting off&nbsp;zombie&nbsp;attacks. Just today, I read a report&nbsp;of a youth who was running home when three or four zombies struck him. He arrived in the doctor&#8217;s facility with a nibble wound&#8230;whereby&nbsp;specialists then observed him until he converted. It&#8217;s clearly beneficial to consider how well you&#8217;re equipped to manage these scenarios as well as have some kind of plan all set in case you get yourself into such a situation. From our perspective, if the worst hits, in our circles it&#8217;s going to come down to zombies versus Wing Chun students. Here are some tips</p>
<h2><b>Zombies are Best to avoid</b></h2>
<p>Without any doubt, your best strategy is to avoid zombies. But, as as one engaging in&nbsp;a Zombies versus Wing Chun Kung Fu all-out war,&nbsp;I would recommend situational cognizance empowers you to observe when zombie scenarios are improving so you can escape without needing to contact. Assuming that you perceive early enough, you can move far from damage by altering your direction or even by crossing the road. You can physically position yourself at favorable element by putting parked autos or different hindrances between you in addition to the dawdling moving danger.</p>
<h2><b>Out of sight means out of mind</b></h2>
<p>Keep in mind that out of sight is equivalent to being out of mind. The sooner you uproot yourself from the zombies&#8217; field of vision, the better. Dodging a strike is best done from a distance. Once the hole between you and them has shut and they have you set up, the scenario is much dicier with a zombies versus Wing Chun scenario. There is a&nbsp;typical way in which the body or&nbsp;frame is integral to the Wing Chun form. Tragically, this&nbsp;doesn&#8217;t work whatsoever with zombies—at least not well. Some self-preservation types&nbsp;claim they&#8217;ve got the mystery equation for stopping&nbsp;zombies using verbal methods instead of hand-to-hand combat, however they don&#8217;t. When the predators complete their prey-choice process, nothing you say will dissuade them. You may be slanted to verbally engage&nbsp;them, particularly those you may have once known. Directly, I would prefer not to be joined with them; I need to withdraw totally.</p>
<h2><b>Wing Chun Helps</b></h2>
<p>The&nbsp;Zombies versus Wing Chun professionals that have survived an attack by the Zombie push into the top side above giving them a cheerful way out as the swarm presses its development. As his catch up strikes cuts into the neck and the neckline bone with the butterfly sword. Hacking, Kicking and Knocking the things back while like Spartans Fossi and Kaseem get long shafts striking advance and splitting skulls like to perfect pros. As the press in Fossi clears out the leg of a zombie as it liberates itself from the glass as well as runs at him. Smacking to the ground Kaseem finalizes it with speedy descending strikes to the head, face and figure. Huge Garret and Tom are laying the smack down their sheer size, speed and power drop the zombies such as flies. Thank God they had outfitted on as the zombies attempt to nibble into the clenched hands hitting into them as they just have it covered. Hence the war ends as well as proving that Wing Chun is A to B right?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Newton&#8217;s law addresses countering energies,&nbsp;essentially saying that they&nbsp;provide an upward and forward counteracting force versus the opposing&nbsp;forces of gravity and rooting (the inertia caused by planting your feet correctly). Because of the principles in Wing Chun countering, we always train students&nbsp;to always press forward and downward—even when traveling backwards. Tension and compression are all acting forces that either push or pull objects at rest together or apart. These countering acting energies become even stronger as they work together and off of one another.</p>
<h2>Wing Chun Countering Energies Increased with Two</h2>
<p>Two partners working together can also generate increased strength and stability that they may have not been able to reach alone.&nbsp; The point of balance between the two objects is called the center of mass, and this is the center of structural stability within this created dynamic. As the strength of one Wing Chun practitioner pushes through the lines of strength of the other, these Wing Chun countering energies&nbsp;and supporting forces create a balance point. Wing Chun works off of triangles found throughout the entire structure. This creates stability because&nbsp;at least one of the connective parts of a triangle is always pointing in the opposite direction of any force being applied. If this triangle or position is broken by leaning, over-committing, or otherwise losing your&nbsp;balance or power, then the triangle will dissolve into another shape and no longer have the structural integrity it once did.</p>
<p>This is why, in Wing Chun, having proper form is everything.</p>
<h2>Countering Energies Through Practicing Continuous Flows</h2>
<p>Depending on your lineage line, you may have attacks and drills that&nbsp;involve&nbsp;continuous flowing chains of offensive and defensive attacks and counters (like ours). Wing Chun is unique in&nbsp;these types of stand up reactive drills and even a third form that trains techniques for surviving and escaping a multiple attacker situation. This type of practical, repetitive&nbsp;training is exclusive to Wing Chun. No other martial art has these types of reaction drills.</p>
<p>A similar energy flow and sensitivity to balance and structure exists within Tai Chi push hands, and this is&nbsp;seen within Chi Sau. Wing Chun adds&nbsp;aggressive attack reactions into the mix. Wrist versus wrist doesn&#8217;t follow predetermined movements but is rather a constant barrage of attacks and reactions at extreme close-quarters. Wing Chun has kept this wrist against wrist tactic in order to keep both practitioners within striking range. Without this constraint, it&#8217;s easy for a student to start to run away or create huge distance between them and the assailant. This is a more&nbsp;realistic practice for dealing with a car assault, home invasion, bar or restaurant attack as the space, chairs, tables, and individuals surrounding you don&#8217;t allow for large, flowing movements. You must deal with what comes and survive or fail based on your training.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Car&nbsp;Assault Example</strong><br />
<i>In&nbsp;the example of a car assault scenario, you are parked next to another vehicle, and you place your child in their seat. By opening the door you have cut off your only means of escape, and the assailant is upon you (plus you potentially have a child to protect). You have no space and no time—only room for a quick reaction. If&nbsp;we move&nbsp;this scenario to nighttime in your home or office, the lights are dim and the attack is on. Wing Chun asks “what if” questions and&nbsp;trains practitioners blindfolded so the only thing you can rely on are the skills instilled in you by your instructor and training. By having even one hand on your assailant in a low light you can “feel” where they are likely to attack&nbsp;(Ex.&nbsp;If the shoulder on one side moves in and down then the other is likely lifting and pulling back to hook punch.)</i></p></blockquote>
<h2>Precise Fighting applications with&nbsp;Wing Chun</h2>
<p>Most people chamber the center torso when attacking with kicks or punches and so,&nbsp;by touching one side of the body, you can determine what the other person is likely to do. This reactive force of pulling back to strike forward can be sensed by the practitioner versus their opponent and can give them a pre-indication of the assailant&#8217;s next intentions. Nothing is foolproof, but if advanced drilling and training in this improves your effectiveness&nbsp;in low light fighting scenarios even a little bit, you can only gain.</p>
<p>Wing Chun&#8217;s small movements and properly timed attacks are used to defeat much larger and stronger attackers. Through proper power, speed, balance, and body structure, a small amount of force can be precisely applied. You not only deflect powerful attacks but expose&nbsp;the opponent&#8217;s vitals momentarily to a devastating counter-attack. Instead of blocking and then attacking as two separate movements, a Wing Chun practitioner will block and attack high and low at the same time. Techniques such as the Intercepting Fist “Cutting Arm” otherwise known as “Turning Punch” can cut into and disrupt the structure and attack of an opponent while allowing the Wing Chun practitioner to overtake and re-root any resistance. Through proven positions of power, the Wing Chun practitioner opens a pathway to the core vitals of their opponent both inside and outside of the assailant. These techniques automatically deflect while a countering attack, punch, and/or kick is delivered.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Training&nbsp;Wing Chun Kung Fu beginners starts right in with the&nbsp;hand to hand intelligent close combat system. Each&nbsp;technique is trained to be extremely effective—and that just takes repetition, dedication, and time. For self-confidence and self defense our program at Sifu Och Wing Chun in Downtown&nbsp;Lakeland florida is an amazing system. Wing Chun Kung Fu,&nbsp;while&nbsp;very well known as a great addition to any martial artist, is also a great system for beginners and those who&#8217;ve never taken a martial arts course before. Many&nbsp;people are joining a martial arts program so they can learn self-defensive techniques, but few understand the difference in the different systems. When training&nbsp;Wing Chun Kung Fu beginners we drill&nbsp;each&nbsp;technique thoroughly until it&#8217;s&nbsp;extremely effective.</p>
<h2>Wing Chun Kung Fu Beginners CAN BE&nbsp;Any Age</h2>
<p>Students of any age can learn Wing Chun Kung Fu because it is very easy to learn. It&#8217;s therefore&nbsp;possible&nbsp;to&nbsp;move into&nbsp;Wing Chun if you are coming&nbsp;from any another martial arts system. You just need to understand some of the fundamental differences in shifting and footwork in addition to centering your body in the proper position. Rather than assuming Wing Chun Kung Fu beginners are kids,&nbsp;the reality is that many are adults—and some have even trained in other martial arts for many years.</p>
<h2>Benefits Wing Chun Kung Fu BEGINNERS CAN EXPECT</h2>
<p><strong>Benefit 1:</strong>&nbsp;Often, the primary purpose of joining a Wing Chun Kung Fu martial arts program is to learn&nbsp;real self-defense. Besides this, however, are&nbsp;other reasons for joining and learning Wing Chun Kung Fu as a beginner. This includes&nbsp;building your self-confidence, physical fitness, and growing in (and focusing) strength. A good Wing Chun Sifu&nbsp;(instructor) will train you in such a way&nbsp;that you can grow and really focus your abilities. As a result you will be able to achieve your goals&nbsp;more quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit 2:</strong>&nbsp;The&nbsp;next benefit is improving your body&#8217;s&nbsp;reflex power. By practicing Wing Chun daily, you will be able to improve your body reflexes along with reaction time and power. Basically, Wing Chun Kung Fu Beginners&nbsp;grow in how quickly they can react to a punch, kick, or dangerous situation.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit 3:</strong> Discipline is yet another factor which can help you grow with the help of Wing Chun Kung Fu. Nowadays, discipline is lacking in most&nbsp;people&#8217;s lives. Wing Chun&nbsp;will truly help you build the power of self-discipline and self-control through consistent&nbsp;practices and meditations.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit 4: </strong>Through learning Wing Chun Kung Fu, students&nbsp;can develop better&nbsp;relationships&nbsp;and even social skills (through a higer level of self-confidence).</p>
<p><strong>Benefit 5:</strong>&nbsp;Wing Chun Kung Fu can really and truly reduce stress. Because&nbsp;both&nbsp;Wing Chun Kung Fu beginners and advanced students spend a good amount of time learning control and practicing focused combinations, the result is that you tend to&nbsp;reduce your body&#8217;s stress levels by keeping&nbsp;it&nbsp;relaxed and controlled.</p>
<p>Sifu Och Wing Chun in Lakeland Florida is&nbsp;simply the best school in the area for developing Wing Chun beginners and advanced students alike. Our&nbsp;training process, Sifu, and instructors are exceptional and care about your personal progress and goals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot of experienced and inexperience students come from various backgrounds, but should you fear Wing Chun training? We don&#8217;t think so at all&#8230;unless you&#8217;re an opponent ad you&#8217;re trained in another martial art that is! Fear comes in two forms: Fear generated by practiced&nbsp;Wing Chun, and fear of starting or engaging in a Wing Chun regimen. These are two very different things.</p>
<h2>You Should Fear Wing Chun</h2>
<p>Cause fear in your opponent, and they will lose their intention to harm. Striking an opponent hard, fast and effectively injuring them will cause fear. When your opponent learns to fear Wing Chun then you may gain a sizable advantage—or even win by default if your attacker runs away).&nbsp;Your goal is to unbalance your opponent&#8217;s foundation and ability to react against you effectively. Fear will have your opponent&#8217;s mind and body in a constant state of unbalance. They will fall back when you attack and second guess their strikes, thus cutting power to them (lack of confidence in a fight = lack of power and intent).&nbsp; Fear is a tool, use it when necessary and know that your opponent may attempt to use this tactic as well. When the mind is distracted it loses power.&nbsp; Whether through fear or distraction the mind is fragile and will fold under a greater pressure. &nbsp;This is the essence of the fight or flight mentality.&nbsp;Fear in Wing Chun or any system of martial arts is natural and the more confident you become in your application the more this fear will melt away.</p>
<p>Remember that Wing Chun is a combative kung fu style based off of muscular/skeletal structure. It draws its power from the intent of controlled full body system muscular skeletal structures recruitment. Allowing the impact of the muscles, body structure and &nbsp;impact points with resisting pressures reinforced by the muscular/skeletal connection with the rest of the body in relation to the ground. This must be attained while directing your strikes at specifically trained areas of the body.&nbsp; Such as the throat, eyes, temple, collar bone, lower floating rib and&nbsp; multiple points around the neck and jaw to name a few.&nbsp; Training these fast twitch muscle fibers (fibers in your muscles responsible for muscle speed and strength) and not tensing those muscles that will hold back or give resistance to those striking structures, means relaxation and explosive power at the end of each strike.</p>
<h2>You Should Not Fear Wing Chun Training</h2>
<p>Learning and getting good at&nbsp;Wing Chun&nbsp;also means training consistently in drills and&nbsp;isolating specific muscle groups. Later training will include using the entire body as a weapon. We do not train for just any type of strike or hit wherever we can. We train for specific places and to achieve specific results. The good news, however, is that student at any level can progress—and students at any level can be effectively trained to eventually become adept at Wing Chun Kung Fu.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wing Chun doesn&#8217;t emphasize elegance, points, or have a sports-oriented mentality.&nbsp;Its only interest is simplicity and using the most highly effective and proficient techniques. Your understanding and ability are based off of your teacher&#8217;s ability and your willingness to learn and practice. If they have it, and can teach it, you&#8217;ll be able to learn&#8230;if you train. Refining the taught applications&nbsp;can not only build strength, it will make you faster. When you get faster, you not only move more quickly into your &#8220;block while attacking&#8221; movements, you develop quick reactions and response times to attacks from your opponent. We believe in conveying real-world training.&nbsp;I&#8217;ve heard all too often about students who have studied under instructors and have been led on for over a <em>decade</em> being told that &#8220;One day they will release ALL of the REAL information to them if they just stick around.&#8221; These same students have come down and—in one afternoon—seen and participated in&nbsp;more effective techniques than they have done in the past ten years—no questions, no tricks, just survival.</p>
<h2>Fighting is Chaotic, train reaction and calculated action.</h2>
<p>Fighting can be unpredictable and chaotic unless you have trained to respond accordingly to the movements and actions of your assailant.&nbsp; Wing Chun&#8217;s applicable reaction should never be pre-calculated or preconceived.&nbsp; How can you decide how a fight will start or end before it has begun?&nbsp; You are not reproducing techniques but rather building a direct response.Refining applications, trained as reactions in kung fu training.&nbsp; Responding to an opponent&#8217;s attack and training combinations that teach flowing response and are continuously&nbsp; interchangeable.</p>
<p>You cannot think faster than an unpredictable attack yet you can train to react appropriately and be extremely effective. Reaction is an innate survival response in every creation, only human&#8217;s can train in various levels, weapons, styles and degrees of response depending on the situation.</p>
<h2>Sifu Och Wing Chun Kung Fu Training in Lakeland FL</h2>
<p>You must train the body to naturally respond to any situation even if you have never faced it before. Wrist against wrist, Chi Sau, Don Chi Sau, and Bong Lop are all examples of Wing Chun training for a natural response. Two partners get together with the goal of assisting the other to develop rooting structure, weed out errors, and have a constant forward energy without leaning or giving up the centerline. Since both practitioners are seeking to train the center offense and defense, a meeting forward energy cancels each other out. By rooting, a Wing Chun practitioner takes the partner&#8217;s energy and roots it through the body then this energy is pressed back from the ground through the practitioner and into the partner once again. By placing and meeting energy, a practitioner can feel and calculate the next position of the partner before they reach their destination.&nbsp; This also means they can diffuse a large portion of the partner&#8217;s force as long as proper body structure is maintained (aka don&#8217;t lean, stop keeping the arms out from the body, completely relax, or stiffen up and attempt to overpower the partner)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some forms and styles of&nbsp;kung fu fighting, including Wing Chun, include&nbsp;the study and use of pressure points. When applied properly, pressure to particular areas of the body produces excruciating pain. This weakness or susceptibility in the human body can help you achieve&nbsp;victory over an assailant or attacker.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Pressure Points Defined:</strong> A pressure point is literally a &#8220;tender spot&#8221; whose entomology can be traced back to the meridian points in traditional Chinese medicine and ancient martial arts. A pressure point is any area on the human body that may produce significant pain or other effect (for example, movement in a particular direction) when pressed, squeezed, or touched in a certain way.</p>
<p>We have many classes that teach the valuable <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/classes/advanced-wing-chun-classes/">Wing Chun techniques</a> associated with finding and exploiting pressure points, and even our&nbsp;<a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/classes/lakeland-after-school-martial-arts-program/">summer after school programs</a> touch upon these to a&nbsp;point. At Sifu Och Wing Chun&nbsp;we emphasize self defense as a means to get away from an attacker through any means possible. While we teach respect, discipline, and self-control, when it comes to protecting your family and loved ones, teaching and training in the aspect of applying and exploiting key pressure points in the human body is something we don&#8217;t shy away from.</p>
<p><b>Some Particular Pressure Points</b><b></b></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Very vulnerable areas</b>: The eyes, the testicles, the shins, etc.</li>
<li><b>Forehead</b>: Striking the flat of the forehead forces the head back with little resistance. Beginners should use the heel of their palm.</li>
<li><b>Shoulder</b>: Look for the collar bone and once located jab fingers behind bone and force to the ground.</li>
<li><b>Throat</b>: The easiest way to strike is probably with a&nbsp;knife hand&nbsp;turned upside down.</li>
<li><b>Under the jaw</b>: Grab the neck on the front and reach under the jaw and squeeze while pressing upward.</li>
</ol>
<p>For those of you thinking that learning about pressure points is way too much for a summer camp in Lakeland, FL (or even an adult class),&nbsp;we tend to ask two questions: &#8220;What would you do to keep your kids safe?&#8221; and &#8220;If you weren&#8217;t there, what would you want your child to do to keep him or herself safe?&#8221; If your child is grabbed, assaulted, or taken by a 200 lb adult, we want to instill some simple skills to even the playing field and give them the skills to escape a potentially dangerous situation. It&#8217;s hard enough for a&nbsp;full-grown adult to stop another adult, so what self-defense skills do you want your child learning? We can teach them and do so in a responsible and respectful manner.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than bent knees and wide stances, Wing Chun stances and rooting provide the basis for the strength and force of each offensive and defensive move. Take, for instance, a &#8220;duck stance&#8221;—most people walk and stand with the toes pointing out from the heels and centerline. When this happens, your center of gravity changes from being underneath you to <em>behind</em> you. When&nbsp;the toes point out and your&nbsp;heels point in, your center is drawn behind you. Though you could bend your knees, widen your stance, or think about rooting, it would not improve your dynamic structure if you are attacked.</p>
<p>Your center of gravity within the various&nbsp;Wing Chun stances and rooting is more than just bending the knees&nbsp;and&nbsp;getting a wider stance. It&#8217;s also more than simply&nbsp;visualizing yourself &#8220;sinking&#8221; into the ground. As my Tai Chi Grandmaster would say: &#8220;these are all great tools, but you&#8217;re still cheating&#8221;—cheating in the sense that anyone can widen their stance or bend their knees to gain this kind of rooting.</p>
<h2>The Source of Good Wing Chun Stances and Rooting</h2>
<p>So where does great rooting come in?&nbsp;First you must question and test your current understanding and abilities in rooting and moving. Wing Chun stances will undoubtedly alter your preconceived ideas about these positions.</p>
<p>Rooting without dynamic movement is useless stance work and impractical. When you practice static rooting or stances without&nbsp;movement it&nbsp;has no purpose or ability against a striking, multi-ranged assailant.</p>
<p>There are many tools and drills we use to check every level of Wing Chun stances and rooting from the arms, chest, hip, and legs into the ground.&nbsp; Rooting downward and striking forward is a mystery to some. I remember learning&nbsp;other styles where&nbsp;the Master would tell us to bend the knees and &#8220;feel&#8221; yourself rooting. This is like saying&nbsp;knowing&nbsp;&#8220;of&#8221; and &#8220;feeling&#8221; out your A, B, C&#8217;s is like knowing, reading, and understanding the &#8216;Freedom From Fear&#8217; by David M. Kennedy.&nbsp; It isn&#8217;t the same and you will always question if your rooting could be better and what you might gain&nbsp;if it was.</p>
<h2>Great Wing Chun Stances and Rooting Questions</h2>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>What does wing chun stances rooting mean if it isn&#8217;t just bending the knee&#8217;s or widening the stance?</em></span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Is rooting for your school of Wing Chun shock value rooting?</em></span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Can you do it if you&#8217;re standing in a bar, restaurant or home or does it need preparation?&nbsp; </em></span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Is it too close or too far apart?&nbsp; </em></span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Does your rooting hold up when caught off guard and someone attacks with something you didn&#8217;t expect?&nbsp; </em></span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Someone comes and pushes you can your rooting recover quickly or do you lose balance easily? </em></span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Is your stance tested and&nbsp;practiced reflex, or is it more of induced movement attached to a sequence of responses?&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p>Can you, while attacking in a fast or vicious manner, maintain this chosen rooting, wide stance, or structure at all times, or do you notice it changing?&nbsp;Choosing a stance that maintains your rooting, structural reinforcement of all of your techniques while keeping and increasing your ability to be dynamic within your footwork are all key.</p>
<h2>Wing Chun Stances disagreements</h2>

<p>Even within Wing Chun there is a disagreement of structure, Wing Chun stances, rooting, distance of footwork, knee positions, and even weight distribution. I have visited many different schools and heard the arguments and justifications of each thought. Some very well known instructors keep the knees in, almost touching each other in order to protect the groin.&nbsp; Other well known teachers have&nbsp;stances that keep 80% of their weight on the front and 100% of their weight on the back foot. Still other&nbsp;teachers claim there is no set stance—just foot work that is used dynamically. The key is whether&nbsp;their students can use it for fighting. If so, then the explaination is backed by the beautiful and sweet music of practical application.</p>
<p>If your foot work can move dynamically; be used practically and under the tenants of pressure, shock, and surprise; and can still hold up and reinforce every attack and block you have, than you are doing your art justice. It&#8217;s easy to use the strikes and footwork of another art but to dive deeper within your own and find the truth and practicality in it preserves the art into the next generation.</p>
<p>We have our own ways of testing our downward rooting while&nbsp;pressing forward in and out of the dynamic representation of Wing Chun. That&#8217;s not to say we are not always students of this amazing art and that we have it perfect—we don&#8217;t. We are always improving, gaining, growing, and seeing new light that Wing Chun has to help us in every aspect of our self defense. Ask the questions, test yourself, and grow within each day as new skills&nbsp;are both discovered and revealed. If you have questions about our footwork and structure, please <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/contact-sifu-och/">feel free to ask&nbsp;us</a>. We would love to continue this discussion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A angry mind full of stress, anxiety, and frustration will cloud the judgment of a Wing Chun Kung Fu practitioner—or any martial artist. Saying this and training for a clear mind are two different things, of course. You must make it a practice, so the body can relax and calm its breathing, heart, and mind when under duress.</p>

<p>Anger management within the martial arts is extremely important. Anger and Wing Chun don&#8217;t mix. Not only is calming the mind important—restraint of primal anger&nbsp;during a confrontation keeps you from having a &#8220;fogged&#8221; perception. The mind needs to be&nbsp;clear in order to fulfill its full capability and goals.&nbsp; Wing Chun Kung Fu demands a clear mind swept of anger in order to be filled with purpose, skill and drive.&nbsp; Though anger can have a drive of its own if not tempered it can run rampant in our lives and destroy that which is built and postive.</p>
<p>Wing Chun Kung Fu strikes such as chops, punches, palms, elbows, head butts, kicks, and knees are coupled with simultaneous blocks, traps, redirects, countering measures, and changing body movements and timing. If you succumb to anger, you won&#8217;t have the mental discipline to remember, let alone execute, the required movements to keep you safe. Stand up strikes require&nbsp;extremely fast targeting, and you need to keep your strikes along the centerline principle of the body. The centerline of the body contains most of the vital areas, pressure points and weaknesses.&nbsp; Though when Wing Chun Gung Fu strikes these points it is concerned with the hitting of fists, elbows and knees into these areas.</p>
<p>Though there are few grappling techniques or holds within Wing Chun Gung Fu as it is seen as a waste to hold when you could be striking.&nbsp; There is in fact the use of quick Chi Na (wrist and joint lock applications) that are taught widely within this system of self defense.</p>
<p>The discipline of Wing Chun teaches many other techniques such as gun defense, stick and knife defense as well as ground defense training.&nbsp; Schools like Sifu Justin Och also teach no-gi ju-jitsu as a addition to in-depth Wing Chun Gung Fu instruction.&nbsp; This addition of no-gi ju-jitsu for ground training and fighting teaches a practitioner that whether stand up or ground Sifu Justin Och students are covered.</p>
<p>Wing Chun Gung Fu is one of the fastest martial arts known, by striking the human bodies vital areas you can shut an assailant down quickly.&nbsp; Whereas a Wing Chun Gung Fu stylist learns to protect these areas.&nbsp; The centerline is the most vital battleground and tactic available to a practitioner.&nbsp; It is the source by which all techniques seek to attain and strike.</p>
<p>All attacks, deflections, redirections, blocks are tools to attack and devastate the centerline vitals such as the throat, knees, groin, eyes, temples, joints, Xiphoid, collar bone and many other areas that can&#8217;t be built up.</p>

<p>The battle ground and warrior tactics within Wing Chun Gung Fu emphasize the short distance between two points is a straight line.&nbsp; Wing Chun Gung Fu teaches you to strike directly instead of indirectly.&nbsp; This aims every attack at this centerline.&nbsp; Wing Chun Gung Fu spends alot of its time training and learning how to direct force, precision and power against this centerline while getting any and all defenses down.</p>
<p>Striking any one of the vitals found along the centerline can end a assailants capability to harm the Wing Chun Gung Fu practitioner.&nbsp; A powerful blow to the throat, collar bone, eyes, groin, knee or joints could very well shut them down.&nbsp; This is why Wing Chun Gung Fu has so many tactics from extremely fast chain punches to turning punches that involve the full momentum of the body, hip, torque, weight and speed.&nbsp; Only one blow is needed but Wing Chun trains for many strikes to ensure increased success for its practitioners.</p>
<p>If above all you want real self defense for you and your family, choose Wing Chun Gung Fu.</p>

<p>Wing Chun asks a lot of questions.&nbsp;For example,&nbsp;even if you&#8217;re strong now, what happens when you&#8217;re attacked and are sick, weakened, have aged, or have incurred an injury? Can you still kick the same, use the same technique, punch the same? Can you struggle for as long, throw the same punches, or use what you have learned from now until the end of your days? What if the person across from you is a violent attacker? We try to teach&nbsp;universal Wing Chun applications that can stand the test of time and continue to work as you age and change.</p>
<p>There are many ways and many martial arts applications that can be used to answer a single situation—and no one martial art or form is perfect. The real answer is that you wan to find a style that can be used universally. A good way to identify a style like that is to see if the techniques and movements can be taught universally to women, children, and men. Removing ego and asking the hard truth, the universal Wing Chun application asks the question: Are you teaching to survive?</p>
<p>Universal Wing Chun applications are trained into quick and natural reactions and responses that will train&nbsp;your body (over time) to build the synapses and muscular reactions necessary for survival. The more time you practice, and the more patience you have to continue, the better you will get. A good technique will become a skilled reaction. Skill is an evolution of understanding, application, applied knowledge, and the ability to adapt.</p>

<p>As you start to understand the technique you gain a vital piece of the puzzle. You may not be able to use the technique yet in fast fighting, but you can see its benefit—and you want it.&nbsp; Second, is application which is the ability to have the body mimic the movement of a technique.&nbsp; During this stage the body doesn&#8217;t yet react under stress in order to apply it as the synapses and muscle memory are still being developed.</p>
<p>Applied knowledge means you are now applying the knowledge under stress as a reaction whether through conscience or unconscious application <em>while under pressure.</em> Last is the ability to adapt under pressure and stress using applied knowledge as a reactionary solution. Bringing&nbsp;this adaptation into the chaos of combat while maintaining your Wing Chun and changing your actions and reactions according to the situation is one of the highest levels of any martial art—especially Universal Wing Chun Kung fu.</p>
<p>For your ability to go through the first three stages takes time and has to be done with each technique you are taught. This is like learning and reacting with a different weapon perfectly. Think of all the different weapons, the differing weights their uses and situational expertise. With each individual technique it takes time and dedication to use, perfect and bring them to a high level of unconscious skill and reaction. The addition of the fourth step means that you can integrate it seamlessly with any of the previous techniques that have made it to the fourth stage. The fourth stage is the accumulation of all your applied knowledge that is capable of adapting, changing and integrating with any other fourth stage skill. Allowing you to bring reactionary control and momentary order under the chaos of combat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Wing Chun Fighter Mindset &#8211; lakeland fl kung fu</h2>
<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t Beat yourself up, with&nbsp;the right training, the right instructor, you will achieve! &#8211; Sifu Justin Och</p></blockquote>
<p><em>(this article can not be copied or used on any other site, permission granted to share link only)</em> With respect to all arts, watch a well versed Ju-jitsu Black Belt on the ground, they no longer struggle, but relax, they seek the openings that their assailant makes available.&nbsp; They work each position with intelligence and resolve and should be respected.The Mindset of a Wing Chun Fighter Calculated decisions are made, reactions and intentions are decisive.</p>
<p>This is the same stand up mindset of a Wing Chun Fighter, working each&nbsp;angle with precision, timing, control,, resolve and intelligence.&nbsp;&nbsp;Enjoying the fight, the reaction, and taking the advantage or adjusting as the reaction of the situation dictates.&nbsp; A Wing Chun Fighter is reactionary knockout speed, power and dynamic flow.&nbsp;&nbsp; A well versed and trained practitioner flows continuously with each counter and reaction their assailant throws letting the assailant show and tell the practitioner where there vital areas are open and exposed.&nbsp; A&nbsp;Wing Chun Fighter Mindset is trained, forged and made into a great piece of internal and external manifested art that flows within time and reaction adapting to each&nbsp;environmental change.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The assailant will show you how to defeat them, each time they move they open up one&nbsp;door by closing another.&nbsp; Each moment a opportunity opens, a vital opens, a counter attack is available and when taken the&nbsp;assailant&nbsp;will&nbsp;attempt to close that opening, always being one step behind the mindset of a Wing Chun fighter, always playing catchup.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wing Chun fighter&nbsp;creates a&nbsp;new opportunity else where within there gate and takes it. &#8221; &#8211; Sifu Justin Och</p></blockquote>

<p>The Mindset of a Wing Chun Fighter Calculated decisions are made, reactions and intentions are decisive.&nbsp; Just knowing the techniques and what to do is not enough you cannot allow distractions to waive your resolve.&nbsp; You are calm but alert, ever ready in your response.&nbsp; You are aware of everything around you and you are allowing your mind and body to take in what is and calculate your responses accordingly.&nbsp;You are not attached to the circumstance but rather you are a part of the whole controlling the flow of every action and the creature in front of you is not your enemy but your prey.The Mindset of a Wing Chun Fighter Calculated decisions are made, reactions and intentions are decisive.&nbsp; &nbsp; They are not human because a human of purpose and good will would have stopped to consider all the individuals they would hurt by hurting you.&nbsp; A human without conscience has no thought of anyone else but themselves. They are selfish, thoughtless, and beasts of burden.</p>

<p>These predators will take from you, rob and kill you for the $5 in your pocket, rape or beat you.&nbsp; These types of humans are nothing more than a loaded gun looking to harm any and all who don&#8217;t give them what they desire when they desire it.&nbsp; The Mindset of a Wing Chun Fighter calls for rapid simultaneous offensive and defensive strikes because one gun shot or one stab could end your life.&nbsp; Minimize as much damage to you and those you love as possible.&nbsp; No Martial Art is perfect or can claim perfection.&nbsp; As martial artists we seek to minimize the damage these types of individuals cause.&nbsp; Thus we seek perfection, peace and long life within the mind, body and spirit, doing our best to support and protect our families and communities.</p>
<p>Wing Chun&nbsp;Kung Fu (Sifu Och, lakeland fl kung fu)&nbsp;seeks all of the appropriated logical and most effective possibilities of counter-attacks and counter measures by an opponent.&nbsp; Wing Chun always attempts to place the opponent&#8217;s body in structurally weak position&#8217;s that are increasingly more advantageous to the Wing Chun practitioner.The Mindset of a Wing Chun Fighter Calculated decisions are made, reactions and intentions are decisive.&nbsp; &nbsp; This is the goal, but getting there takes practice, honing ones skill and utilizing these techniques, concepts and drill them into application.&nbsp; Mastering Wing Chun Kung Fu means complete combat application of gate theory, angling, stepping inward, around and backward while attacking and countering.&nbsp; It means mastering many different approaches and solutions to a single problem, so you keep your opponents guessing while taking advantage of centerline structure, speed and power.&nbsp;&nbsp; It means sparring and applying your knowledge against a multitude of styles and scenarios.&nbsp; Reaction, power and speed of both hands and feet depend on the attack, attacker and the situation at hand.&nbsp; A series of jabs and crosses will allow some practitioners to move in quickly taking advantage of the forward knee that the opponent presents with each jab and cross.&nbsp; Taking out this knee, hip or ribs when exposed will have the opponent&#8217;s body and mind off balance as you continue pressing inward with forward strikes.&nbsp; This same attack may be seen from another practitioner&#8217;s perspective as an opportunity to stay farther away.&nbsp; Biding time while the Wing Chun Kung Fu&nbsp;practitioner analyzes the opponent&#8217;s tactics allowing the practitioner to strike and injury.&nbsp; The opponent&#8217;s arms, legs and other weapons as they present themselves within the fight.&nbsp; This may be done to weaken a stronger opponent, while frustrating them into making mistakes or moving in a direction that has been set up by the Wing Chun Kung Fu practitioner.</p>

<p>Everything we have discussed thus far and have yet to discuss is all within the mindset of a Wing Chun Kung Fu practitioner within my school.&nbsp; I make sure of it.&nbsp; Your protection is a lifetime of achievement.The Mindset of a Wing Chun Fighter Calculated decisions are made, reactions and intentions are decisive.&nbsp; &nbsp; It is invaluable to you, your loved ones, and every single person you may touch in a positive way throughout your life.&nbsp; PROTECT THAT, because the person attacking you doesn&#8217;t care about your future, doesn&#8217;t care about your loved ones, or about what you have done for your community or your children.&nbsp; The person attacking you only cares about themselves.&nbsp; They have no conscience. If they did, they never would&#8217;ve attacked you and all those who care for you in the first place.</p>
<p>Everything is wishful thinking Every theory, every drill and every application spoken about or shown is only wishful thinking until you make it your own.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t live in just the understanding of concept but the conceptualization of proof and reaction.The Mindset of a Wing Chun Fighter Calculated decisions are made, reactions and intentions are decisive.&nbsp; &nbsp; We cannot live on the stories of our Master&#8217;s or our Great Grandmaster&#8217;s but rather prove their training and applications&nbsp;through our own existence and application.&nbsp; So we can prove and honor the existence they lived for to teach us.&nbsp; The existence they strived for and gave to&nbsp;us.&nbsp; It is truly a power for the protection of others, when we seek to uplift those that uplift others.&nbsp; Through friendship, love and honor, I look forward to each practitioner I meet that wishes to welcome each other as family under our love for real self defense.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure reading this article&nbsp;has left you questions about my&nbsp;way of Wing Chun Kung Fu in Lakeland Florida.&nbsp; I have begun writing these&nbsp;thoughts and perspectives from my travels, practitioners, Masters and Grandmaster&#8217;s I have met that have touched and changed my thoughts on Wing Chun Kung Fu and how Ip Man evolved within this amazing system known as Wing Chun.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Lakeland Fl Kung Fu, our Wing Chun is a system of concept, purpose and drive, in a sense a pure love for Wing Chun Kung Fu.The Mindset of a Wing Chun Fighter Calculated decisions are made, reactions and intentions are decisive.</p>
<p>This website is only a brief anthology of my experience and thoughts. Thus there is so much more I can show and teach in person.&nbsp;Come and visit our&nbsp;Wing Chun&nbsp;kung fu school in lakeland, fl.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&nbsp;would love to continue this discussion and thank you for your reading.</p>

<p>A good technique works or doesn&#8217;t work, that is all.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t have to be forced or imposed.&nbsp; Do not imagine a new technique you create, see or even have been trained in, will work.&nbsp; It must be proven to have merit and not fit a dogmatic principle set upon the instructor or student.&nbsp; For my part, I do not believe in fancy technique or training that does not have an extreme survival purpose.&nbsp; It gives no life protection and is more about “play” then reality.&nbsp; From the beginning there have been two types of schools.Keep reading, but more importantly come down to the Sifu Och Wing Chun Universal Kung Fu academy in downtown lakeland fl, where individuals all over lakeland and central florida travel for realistic self defense, kung fu classes, and street self defense for the entire familyThose who use &#8220;show&#8221; techniques, and those who fight for survival.&nbsp; For me, martial arts is about survival.&nbsp; Once force or pressure is placed on a bad or fancy technique, no matter how much you want it to be good or work, it will fail.</p>

Why don&#8217;t they just squeeze harder into your chest as you attempt to lift and smash you into a wall or sharp object?&nbsp; Does your training involve this as part of the bear hug, or does the person just lift their arms with your motion and stand there for counter-attacks?Keep reading, but more importantly come down to the Sifu Och Wing Chun Universal Kung Fu academy in downtown lakeland fl, where individuals all over lakeland and central florida travel for realistic self defense, kung fu classes, and street self defense for the entire family</p>
<p>During a bear hug does your school train to grab the leg between yours and attempt to pull the assailant down?&nbsp; If so, then do you also practice to have the assailant move their foot and plant your face and body&#8217;s momentum into concrete, since that is where you are headed since your reaching downward toward the ground which breaks your structure and base?Keep reading, but more importantly come down to the Sifu Och Wing Chun Universal Kung Fu academy in downtown lakeland fl, where individuals all over lakeland and central florida travel for realistic self defense, kung fu classes, and street self defense for the entire family</p>

<p>If your art shows to grab the side of the person and bring them to the ground, are you a master practitioner in ground fighting?Keep reading, but more importantly come down to the Sifu Och Wing Chun Universal Kung Fu academy in downtown lakeland fl, where individuals all over lakeland and central florida travel for realistic self defense, kung fu classes, and street self defense for the entire familyThose who use &#8220;show&#8221; techniques, and those who fight for survival. I ask because as you throw anyone they have a tendency to hold onto and attempt to take down the practitioner with them.&nbsp; Also, if your assailant is bigger than you which is usually the case, when you are bear hugged can all of the women, children and men you teach take out someone on the cold asphalt of broken glass, oil and harsh reality of the ground?</p>
<p>A technique to be taught universally has to work universally to every size against every size.&nbsp; Wing Chun asks this of every application and technique taught&nbsp; It is up to the practitioner or instructor to ignore or take in these facts.&nbsp; If you are a 210lbs male then almost any reaction, technique or struggle will probably work for you. As no matter what your martial art is, you already have power and strength.Keep reading, but more importantly come down to the Sifu Och Wing Chun Universal Kung Fu academy in downtown lakeland fl, where individuals all over lakeland and central florida travel for realistic self defense, kung fu classes, and street self defense for the entire familyThose who use &#8220;show&#8221; techniques, and those who fight for survival.&nbsp; Yet Wing Chun and our school asks you, If a 120lbs woman or child used that same technique would it work against a violent 210lb male with the intent of huge physical harm and control on the victim in question.&nbsp; Search within your heart and ask “what are the major flaws of this and how would I counter-attack to kill, harm or bring violence upon this person”.</p>
