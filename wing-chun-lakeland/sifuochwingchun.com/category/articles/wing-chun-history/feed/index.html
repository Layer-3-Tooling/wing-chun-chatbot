										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Born and raised in Vietnam, I have known Wing Chun as “Vịnh Xuân” which carries the same meaning of “eternal spring”. However, my knowledge about Wing Chun was limited. I assumed that it is just another Chinese martial arts with fancy moves but not applicable in a modern day situation. Not until recently, the Ip Man movie series ignited my interest in Ip Man and the history of Wing Chun. In my paper,&nbsp;Hung Nguyen: Reaching Orange Sash I will tell you my story.</p>
<h2>Hung Nguyen: Reaching Orange Sash</h2>
<p>I came to find out that Wing Chun is a martial arts that emphasizes in realistic defense, economic motions, and bodily structure. Since Wing Chun was initially developed for women, it focuses on “getting the job done” rather than fancy flying kicks or breaking wooden blocks. It uses body mechanics with minimal movements to simultaneously strike and defense.</p>
<h3>Dedication</h3>
<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>I have always wanted to improve my health, strength and overall wellness. However, like many others, I failed to stick with the mundane routine gym work outs. I knew at that time that I need to make a change. I wanted to do something that is interesting and beneficial for my health. The combination of my personal goal and interest in Wing Chun leads me to look for a Wing Chun school in the area.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8896 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/24104512/Hung-2-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/24104512/Hung-2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/24104512/Hung-2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/24104512/Hung-2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/24104512/Hung-2-400x400.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/24104512/Hung-2-600x600.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/24104512/Hung-2.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />My first impression of Tampa Wing Chun Kung Fu is the dedication and friendliness of the instructor, Garret Brumfield. He took the time to explain the basic moves and concept of Wing Chun, helping the students to have a better understanding of Wing Chun. He created a friendly environment which is built upon the enthusiasm of Wing Chun and the respect for each other. Over the past year, my strength and health have improved significantly due to Wing Chun. Garret has always pushed me to work harder not just in Wing Chun technicians but also other aspects such as strength, cardio, and endurance.</p>
<h3>The Difference Here</h3>
<p>While I have never trained in any form of martial arts previously, I have heard many stories about bad experience with martial arts schools. Many schools focus on pushing students through the systems for financial reasons. Students from those schools can quickly earn a black belt in relatively short amount of time. However, they quickly forget what they learned or don’t know how to apply in real life situation. The students are left little training and most importantly with a false sense of security. In my opinion, it is more dangerous to over confident about your ability to self-defense.</p>
<h3>Application</h3>
<p>Unlike many other Wing Chun schools where they focus chi-sao but little in real life situations. The curriculum of Sifu Och Wing Chun is detailed and vast in techniques. Sifu Och Wing Chun emphasizes on basic techniques. It also teaches students to be efficient in attacks and defenses in realistic scenarios. The curriculum is built to ensure that the students can master the techniques. This is done through constant repetition and deep understanding of the concept. Sifu Och has traveled the world and trained under many direct lineages of Ip Man Wing Chun system. He distilled his knowledge to a curriculum in which the best of traditional Wing Chun meets self-defense techniques. This even includes other form<u>s</u> of martial arts.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Finally, Tampa Wing Chun Kung Fu and Sifu Och Wing Chun not only have helped me physically but also mentally. Garret and others have motivated me to keep coming to class even at the times when life gets in the way. They helped me to build up my discipline and determination to make a change and improve my overall well-being. At the end of the day, there is no substitution for dedication and time to mastery in Wing Chun or anything else in life. I am glad and very grateful that I have found Sifu Och Wing Chun and Tampa Wing Chun Kung Fu. It has had a positive impact in my life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7422 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/24103536/ving-tsun-history-1-300x216.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="216">Here on Tony Plasse: Becoming an Orange I explain my story but first, some history. Wing Chun a southern Chinese martial art mentioned during the period of the Red Boat Opera in the Late 1800s. Developed by southern Shaolin monks to help combat the Manchurians. It is influenced by other Fujian martial arts that preferred short steps and close fighting, with arms placed close to the chest and elbows close to the flanks offering protection. A simple boxing form quickly mastered by dedicated practitioners.</p>
<p>Two key figures keeping Wing Chun system alive after the burning of southern temples were Yat Chum Dai Si, 22<sup>nd</sup> generation Siu Lam Grandmaster monk, and Cheung Ng, also known as Tan Sao Ng within the opera. It was taught to other rebels taking refuge with the opera. From there it spread along the coast and rivers of south-eastern China by people who lived by and on the water. The Shaolin nun myth was most likely created to protect the identities of the creators and perpetrators of the Wing Chun system. Wing Chun translates to Spring Chant or Spring Praise.</p>
<h2>Tony Plasse: Becoming an Orange</h2>
<p>I remember my first introduction to Wing Chun Kung Fu was an Ip Man movie three years ago. Did not know much about it, but the movie inspired me to research it. I liked the theory behind and thought it would be more practical for myself. High flying kicks, although cool looking, are not my style. When I finally had the opportunity to attend a class near my house I thought to myself, &#8220;this is great&#8221;.</p>
<h3>My Reaction</h3>
<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>I <img decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7290 size-full" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/24103358/tony-plass.jpg" alt="" width="297" height="236">have spent the last year training with Sihing Garret and I have noticed improvements in myself. Garret emphasizes physical training at the beginning of each class. I have improved muscle tone and stamina. Wing Chun techniques taught to me have improved my reflexes much to my surprise. Not just in wrist against wrist but in everyday applications. I react to things such as doors flying at my face. I caught one once with a Jum Sau action. The lady next to me said “Wow! That was like a ninja!”. I also catch the items knocked off shelves with a lot more ease.</p>
<h3>My Confidence</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8148 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/24104036/Tony-Plasse-Wing-Chun-Kung-Fu-Tampa-Bay-Florida-153x300.jpg" alt="Tony-Plasse-Wing Chun Kung Fu Tampa Bay Florida" width="153" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/24104036/Tony-Plasse-Wing-Chun-Kung-Fu-Tampa-Bay-Florida-153x300.jpg 153w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/24104036/Tony-Plasse-Wing-Chun-Kung-Fu-Tampa-Bay-Florida.jpg 221w" sizes="(max-width: 153px) 100vw, 153px" />The wrist against wrist drill has helped my sensitivity improve into reaction. It has given me more confidence in handling myself. I always knew my normal movements gave me power. But now I am learning to channel that power more efficiently through stance and technique. I am more confident that I’m more prepared for situations when I’m out on the town or at work. I believe there are many applications I could have used previously in my life as a football player. Namely the footwork and center line punch drill. Both would have greatly helped me as an offensive lineman and coach. It also adds to my overall scariness.</p>
<h3>My Future</h3>
<p>As the days grow closer to my son’s birth, I look forward to sharing Wing Chun with him. I hope he will benefit from Wing Chun training developing skill, balance and confidence. I see Wing Chun as an opportunity to develop father and son bonds.</p>
<p>The instruction and encouragement I receive is outstanding. Sihing Garret and Sifu Och inspire me to dedicate myself and continue training. I hope to be an inspiring instructor one day. I look forward to progressing and to be a good representative of Tampa Bay Wing Chun Kung Fu and Sifu Och Wing Chun.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dit Da Jow Basics will explain what Dit Da Jow is and some of its uses. Dit Da Jow is an ancient Chinese healing liniment used both externally (rubbed onto the skin) and internally (ingested in small amounts). Externally it stimulates circulation in order to improve the healing of injuries as well as reduce pain and swelling. Internally it improves blood flow as well as Qi. One can improve its effects by applying the liniment before injury occurs. Such as in the case of conditioning or regular martial arts practice. If someone is throwing a punch at you, even an effective block can cause bruising. Many martial artists may consider bruises to be lesser injuries that will heal themselves; however, repeated injury to the same area may end up causing stagnant blood or Qi which may create greater problems later. The Dit Da Jow breaks up the stagnation and improves the overall health of the practitioner.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: medium;">Dit Da Jow Basics: Ingredients and Methods</span></h2>
<p>Often times the recipes for Dit Da Jow were well kept secrets and passed down through generations by oral or written tradition. Though these recipes for Dit Da Jow will vary greatly, some of the most common ingredients are:</p>
<p>Mustard Seed</p>
<p>Cardamom</p>
<p>Clove</p>
<p>Pumice</p>
<p>Cinnamon</p>
<p>Ginger</p>
<p>Safflower</p>
<p>Tumeric</p>
<p>Sulfer</p>
<p>Myrrh</p>
<p>Citrus Peel</p>
<p>Frankincense</p>
<p>Comphrey</p>
<p>Pine Bark</p>
<p>Peach Kernel</p>
<p>Camphor</p>
<p>Yarrow</p>
<p>Willow Bark</p>
<p>Cayenne</p>
<p>Mucuna Seed</p>
<p>Originally practitioners combined the herbs for the Dit Da Jow with rice wine and put the mixture into a clay vessel that was then buried underground. Today the ingredients above (as well as others not mentioned) are usually combined in various amounts with vodka or gin. The higher the percentage alcohol, the better the extraction of the herbs. As low as 80 proof vodka should be sufficient, but some people choose to use up to 190 proof vodkas. After combining the herbs with the alcohol, the mixture must sit for a minimum of three months. Though the mixture may have a better effectiveness the longer it brews. Many practitioners will allow their Dit Da Jow to sit for years before use.</p>
<p>The ingredients of this liniment often have either cold or hot effects on the body. A Dit Da Jow made up of warmer ingredients is more often used in conditioning and with chronic injuries. On the other hand, Dit Da Jow made with cooler ingredients is better suited for newer injuries with high inflammation.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: medium;">Uses</span></h2>
<p>To understand the use of Dit Da Jow on bruising, we must first understand what a bruise is. We all know that bruising happens when the body suffers a forceful blow or trauma of some kind. The skin then starts to turn different colors and becomes sensitive to touch or movement. This trauma sometimes causes small blood vessels to break, causing red blood cells to collect under the skin. Use of Dit Da Jow on a bruise can improve circulation and reducing stagnation of the red blood cells under the skin.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7406" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/24103521/wing-chun-history.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="216"></p>
<p>Dit Da Jow is also used to aid in the process of conditioning. Conditioning is a common martial arts practice that is often done by repeatedly striking a specific area of the body (i.e. shins, forearms, fists…) against something or someone. Practitioners will do this in order to make that area stronger and less susceptible to injury. Dit Da Jow can help in the conditioning process in two ways: applying proactively to reduce the likelihood of buising, and/or afterwards to speed the healing process.</p>
<p>Whatever the formula of used, or the reason for using it, Dit Da Jow still holds an important place in martial arts culture and practice. Not to mention the herbs make it smell fantastic and it is a great excuse to buy vodka.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Both western and eastern martial arts have great merit and training techniques. Easily improving discipline, fitness, and overall health; but there are some major differences.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/western-vs-eastern-martial-arts/">Western vs. Eastern Martial Arts</a> appeared first on <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com">Sifu Och Wing Chun</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When asked about the origins of martial arts, most people will gravitate toward thoughts of Asia and the east. And though the majority of martial arts do originate in the east, the west has certainly produced credible martial arts as well as adopting eastern martial art practices. A few western martial arts include: boxing, fencing, wrestling, and jousting (as well as eastern martial arts that have adapted to the west). While some eastern martial arts include: kung fu, aikido, escrima, and karate. The differences between training in west versus training in the east are primarily in the mindset of the practitioners and the rituals of the dojo, rather than actual differences in technique (though those are sure to exist as well).</p>
<h2>Western Martial Arts</h2>
<p>In the west the time it takes to learn a martial art is shorter and more optimized. Allowing for practitioners to achieve the rank of black belt in as little as three years (with some programs promising less). This optimization is in line with the (often) western mindset of consumerism. The craving for immediate results can cause much disappointment to those who are use to short term satisfaction. They often compare themselves to students who have been practicing for years and wonder why they are unable to produce the same results. This frequently leads to students quitting early on, due to either disappointment, frustration, or boredom.</p>
<p>Because of this phenomenon, western martial arts felt the need to streamline their programs. This helped to keep students both physically and mentally engaged in their classes. On top of wanting a shorter martial arts program, westerners are also highly concerned with the practical. Western martial arts generally have no room for ritual. And less practical practices that may be present in their eastern counterparts.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-7843 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103753/fighting-fitness-300x200.jpg" alt="Know your fighting fitness" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103753/fighting-fitness-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103753/fighting-fitness-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103753/fighting-fitness-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103753/fighting-fitness-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103753/fighting-fitness.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h2>Eastern Martial Arts</h2>
<p>In the east there seems to be a greater respect for the amount of time it takes to truly learn a martial art. Eastern martial arts will (generally) take longer to achieve the rank of black belt. Many requiring ten years and some even longer. That is assuming that the individual is regularly practicing multiple times a week, pushing themselves toward their goal. Eastern martial arts also emphasize the concept of loyalty and perseverance. Loyalty to the martial art and to one’s dojo and master are key components in the practice.</p>
<p>Many eastern martial arts developed from a need to be able to revolt or defend themselves in times of war. For example, slave would do Karate forms to defy to their drivers. After a long day of work, they did these forms in a line on the rail-roads they were being forced to build. The slaves sought to display strength, power, and endurance despite the work that they were being forced to do.</p>

<h2>Adaptation</h2>
<p>Both western and eastern martial arts have great merit and training techniques. Easily improving discipline, fitness, and overall health; but there are some major differences. These differences can affect the entire training regimen and lead to the overall perception of the art itself. If someone is looking for an eastern martial art in the west, has the art adapted to cater to the western mindset or does it hold true to the east? In the same way, looking for one of the western martial arts in the east that holds true to western values may be difficult as well. Does an art exist that is purely eastern or western? Free from ideals from the opposing side? When choosing a martial art the decision is not necessarily eastern or western. Instead one should look at has the art developed over time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Krav Maga is renowned for is brutality and viciousness. The Israeli military adopted it because it can be taught in a short amount of time. Wing Chun, made famous by Bruce Lee and the recent &#8220;Ip Man&#8221; movies, is known for its speed and ability to devastate an attacker. In recent years there has been a rise in both across the US. How are the two connected and why the sudden growth in popularity? We will delve into that in this article.</p>
<h2>40&#8217;s-90&#8217;s</h2>
<p>In a post WWII world interaction and fascination with Japan was at it&#8217;s height. Many Japanese now lived in the US. Interaction with the American culture grew and grew. With the interaction came Karate which spread across the US like wild fire. However, as with any trend, there are people that would take advantage of that only for monetary gain. Karate, as a legitimate art, began to become watered down. Even though there existed many good schools (and many still do), the general public started to notice the negative trend. By and large Karate in the US morphed from a powerful, dangerous art, to a weaker cousin that was only suited for tournaments and scoring points. This shift paved the way for something new to take hold.</p>
<p><em>(Writer&#8217;s note: This section of the Article is not a stab at Karate. It is simply pointing out the unfortunate decline of authenticity as a whole in the US.)</em></p>
<h2>&nbsp;Modern Krav Maga Versus Wing Chun</h2>
<p>With Bruce Lee&#8217;s explosion onto the scene, Kung Fu (specifically Wing Chun) started to get some of the limelight. Around the same time Krav Maga started to make it&#8217;s way to the US. With Wing Chun focusing on the most direct route to it&#8217;s target and Krav using a blend of styles to achieve maximum brutality, the stage was set for the two to emerge. However, before we continue with their growth in the U.S. lets look at some differences and similarities between the two.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8309" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24104111/imi01.jpg" alt="" width="282" height="176"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-7559 " src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/24103616/Phoenix-Eye-Fist-300x202.jpg" alt="Learn These Three Moves" width="260" height="175" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/24103616/Phoenix-Eye-Fist-300x202.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/24103616/Phoenix-Eye-Fist-768x517.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/24103616/Phoenix-Eye-Fist-400x270.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/24103616/Phoenix-Eye-Fist-600x404.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/24103616/Phoenix-Eye-Fist.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Similarities </strong></h3>
<p>Both Krav and Wing Chun were designed at a time of war. Wing Chun during the 17th century China at civil war and Krav during the 1930 right after WW1 and prior to WWII. Wing Chun was designed originally to be a system that could be learned in a fraction of the time of the available Kung Fu systems. In the same way, Krav fused boxing, judo, juijistu , and aikido to create something that Jewish civilians could immediately defend themselves with. In recent times Krav has added Maui Thai and actually some Wing Chun (through Jeet Kune Do) into its system. They both seek to dispatch their opponent as quickly as possible. Additionally, both systems &#8220;fight dirty&#8221;, using any means necessary to prevail.</p>
<h3><strong>Differences </strong></h3>
<p>Now even with Wing Chun&#8217;s addition to Krav Maga there will obviously still be differences. First to be addressed would be training time. Modern Wing Chun takes anywhere from 8-10 years to finish the system.* Whereas the entire Krav system can be learned (on a military style training regiment) in four months to a year. Both of these depended on the dedication of the student of course. Second, Wing Chun was designed as a complete system with which all parts fuse together and flow seamlessly. Comparatively, Krav fused many styles so there will naturally be some disconnect systems.</p>
<p>The third difference would be training style. One perk of a Krav School is that they tend to really focus on the brutality of combat. Understanding, right from the beginning, how chaotic combat can be. The right mindset is instilled right from the start and can be seen all throughout their training. Wing Chun on the other hand does utilize more finesse. In training the &#8220;soft&#8221; side the harshness of combat can sometimes be lost in some schools.</p>
<p>In Closing, both systems are effective in street combat. With Karate, and a few other arts, becoming very commercialized, the public wanted something new. Something that gets right to the point and gets the job done. That is the reason for the two arts quick rise to fame. Now with all arts both Krav and Wing Chun have also fallen prey to commercialization. So before choosing a school do your homework on the instructors! Once you choose, train hard and stay committed!</p>
<h3>*(Writers note: Wing Chun in the 17th century was designed to be learned in 3 years. This was accomplished by monks training 8 hours a day consistently.)</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wing Chun teaches only two weapons formally. The Long Pole and the Butterfly swords, both showcased in the Ip Man Series of movies, are powerful weapons that have very interesting pasts. While they are both very effective, neither of them were design originally to kill. This is due to their Shaolin roots. We will present the history of both the Long Pole and Butterfly Swords to better understand them.</p>
<h2>Shaolin and the bo staff</h2>
<p>The Shaolin staff, also called Bo staff or Dragon staff, dates back to China’s early Sung Dynasty (960-1279). Favored among Shaolin monks it served as weapon and multi-purpose tool. They used the staff not only for self defense but also for extending reach, moving objects, walking stick on travels. Bound by their philosophy of understanding and helping people, monks used the Bo staff to defeat the opponent without inflicting fatal injury.</p>
<h2>The first of Wing Chun Weapons: Long pole</h2>
<p><a name="_GoBack"></a> The use of the Bo staff continued well into the Qing Dynasty (1644-1922) eventually becoming a military training routine taught by adept monks. Among the weapon experts was one monk by the name of Ji Sin (Gee Sin), a shaolin monk of the Sil Lum Temple. One of the Five Legendary Elders of Sil Lum, Ji Sin was an expert in various martial arts styles including the Dragon staffs Luk Dim Boom Gwan form. In 1723, political differences resulted in destruction of the temple and its residents by order of the Qing government; fortunately, Ji Sin was able to escape. Coincidentally Ng Mui, another Buddhist monk, also escaped. She later passed on her knowledge of martial arts to Yim Wing Chun: the source of Wing Chun&#8217;s, the martial art&#8217;s, name.</p>
<p>To avoid the government, Ji Sin laid low as a cook aboard the Red Junk<sup>1</sup>. Among the members of the Red Junk was the pole man, Leung Yee Tai. Already accustomed to working with the long pole Leung Ye Tai became interested in learning martial arts from Ji Sin. He then taught Leung Yee Tai the form of the Luk Dim Boom Gwan.</p>
<p>Later, Leung Yee Tai met and befriended Wong Wah Bo, an opera performer and also a master in Wing Chun. The two then became both student and master to one another, teaching the knowledge of their martial arts and learning the others martial arts. Through their mutual sharing they discovered that parts of the Wing Chun system perfected the form and technique of the Luk Dim Boom Gwan. After this discovery the two officially incorporated the Luk Dim Boom Gwan into the system of Wing Chun as one of its two weapon forms.</p>

<h2><b>How the Baat Cham Dao came to Wing Chun</b></h2>
<p>The history of the butterfly swords incorporation into Wing Chun is not as clear as the Dragon staff and its form: Luk Dim Boom Gwan. The earliest historic reference of the butterfly swords date back to the 1820’s, but this is debated. Shaolin monks highly valued the butterfly sword for its means of training and defense. Their Buddhist philosophy heavily influenced the dual swords design.&nbsp;Strictly prohibited from taking a life, the monks used the swords to disarm, parry, and cut opponents, incapacitating them. Aside from the first 3 inches of the blade, the blade was dull on both sides and for several reasons: first, it strengthened their caution of killing the opponent; second, the dull blade added extra support to the swords structure; third, a heavier weapon&nbsp;could easily damage a sharpened edge .</p>
<h2>The Butterfly Knives Creation</h2>
<p>According to history, the Fut Pai Hung Mun (Buddhist Hung Mun), a secret society that operated within the Southern Shaolin Temple, created the Kung Fu double butterfly knives. The sole purpose of the society was to oppose the Ching Dynasty and restore the Ming Family to the throne. Cheung Ng (Tan Sao Ng), a member of the society, was a highly educated man with much knowledge in both military and literary skills. He also a master of the butterfly swords and the art that was to become Wing Chun.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Cheung Ng was forced to flee to Guangdong Province after the Southern temple fell to the Qing forces but continued the society’s goal. It is said that Cheung Ng then remodified the butterfly swords taking away its non-lethal characteristics and creating a more practical battlefield weapon. Trimming the front of the blade giving a curvature and sharpened point, giving off the appearance of a large dagger, accommodated stabbing and thrusting motions. After a while the swords form continued to evolve.</p>

<h2>Mondern Day Baat Cham Dao</h2>
<p>Swords took their modern form during the 19<sup>th</sup> century. The Butterfly swords are no exception as they took on their current form during this time. As previously mentioned the butterfly swords and form, Baat Cham Dao, and their incorporation to Wing Chun is unclear. Regardless, the swords are seen as a valuable part is the Wing Chun system increasing one power, strength and flexibility.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup>Junk – ancient Chinese sailing ship. Used as early as the 2<sup>nd</sup> century AD then showed a rapid increase during the Sung Dynasty, and evolved through later dynasties. Regularly found throughout South-East Asia and India. Sailors believed they could persuaded dragons in the clouds to help them instead of harming them if they sailed with bright colors. They also believed that red was the best color for this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Japanese Martial arts</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">In our previous article, Martial Arts Philosophy-Chinese Versus Japanese Part 2, we covered the Chinese side. In this article we will go over Japanese martial arts. Japanese martial arts bases its principles heavily on certain beliefs—religious or not—depending on the style. Shintoism (an ethnic Japanese religion) is a strong fundamental in the art of Aikido. Even some of the religious beliefs from China managed to merge its way into the countries martial arts; Zen (Chan) Buddhism became a respected principle in the art of Bushido (way of the warrior) and Budo (martial way). For most Japanese martial arts the same purpose applies to those of Chinas: focusing development of “The Trinity” (body, mind and spirit). </span></p>
<h2>Shotokan Karate</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"> Shotokan Karate, developed by Gichin Funakoshi, bases its precepts closely on Zen Buddhism and Bushido. From these two philosophies Funakoshi laid out the twenty principles of Shotokan philosophy. Later the five Dojo Kun was developed by the Japan Karate Association. Under no circumstance should one of the principles be valued more than another. By taking those into account, and through years of practice, a karate practitioner (karateka) will be able to develop a calm and opened mind and achieve confidence, humility, wisdom etc. In addition to that they will hone the body to become harmonious with the mind which will give a “subconscious” control over the body’s movement. The body performs the techniques while the mind remains serene. This will then have a direct proportional effect on the spirit as well and will create a wholeness of one’s self. </span></p>
<h2>Aikido</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"> Some of Zen’s religious principles are also structured in the art of Aikido though the bulk of it comes from the countries traditional religion of Shintoism and its strong belief in spiritual essence. Aikido, founded by Morihei Ueshiba, centers its techniques on the flow of ki (also known as chi or qi in Chinese culture) that translates to “life force” or “energy flow”. Ki is universal—everything possesses it—and it can be a means to transfer external energy internally. Internal ki is channeled throughout the body by the mind that in turn channels the power. Only when mind and body are harmonious can this be achieved and used to redirect and neutralize the energy of opposing force. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> The art of Aikido also believes in the value of self-discovery and self-development and discourages any form of hierarchy. It’s not an art used to distinguish which is superior over the other; it is only used for means of protection. This also applies to winning and losing which is why the art disapproves contests and competitions. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-8293 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24104105/aikido69-300x201.jpg" width="300" height="201" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24104105/aikido69-300x201.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24104105/aikido69-768x516.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24104105/aikido69-400x269.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24104105/aikido69-600x403.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24104105/aikido69.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER"><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Modern Martial Arts</b></span></span></h2>
<p align="CENTER">In conclusion to both articles we want touch on modern arts. Both Chinese and Japanese arts share a common bond of self development at their core. Through training practitioners sought enlightenment. In modern training the focus is not so much on self development as it used to be. Many arts now serve to prepare students solely for competition. Instead of helping student&#8217;s become better people they only focus on techniques and tactics to win medals.</p>
<p align="CENTER">Although schools still do exist that instill strong principles, it is not part of the modern martial art culture. Not even mentioning what can be called &#8220;black belt factories&#8221;. Schools that seek to do nothing but move student&#8217;s through for financial gain. These types of schools will wave flashy promises of black belt awards if x amount of money is paid. Or some will simply skim the surface of an art so that students can breeze through the material. As a result many &#8220;black belt&#8221; students come as a result.</p>
<p align="CENTER">Whatever you train, Chinese, Japanese, or any Modern art you find, seek to grow as a person.</p>

<h3><span style="font-size: medium;">When broken up, martial is referred to as “those inclined to war or fighting”.&nbsp; Art is referred to as “the expression or</span> <span style="font-size: medium;">creative skill and imagination”. Thus, martial arts is to be translated as “the expression of creative fighting skills”. Some (possibly the majority) of the practices still firmly embrace this concept.&nbsp; However there are other practices that use martial arts as a catalyst and add it with the practices philosophy in order to create a new self. In this part of our two part series titled &#8220;Martial Arts Philosophy-Chinese Versus Japanese Part 1&#8221;, we will cover the Chinese side of the two lines of thinking.<br />
</span></h3>
<div id="TextSection" dir="LTR">
<h3><span style="font-size: medium;">Martial = inclined to war or fighting </span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-size: medium;">Art = expression or creative skill</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martial Arts = Expressive or Creative Skill in Fighting </span></h3>
<h2 style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER"><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Chinese Martial Arts</b></span></span></h2>
</div>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Despite it having a combat effectiveness, Kung Fu (also pronounced Gung Fu) is founded on the philosophy of attaining intelligence and wisdow. Two qualities that take years to develop and attain. Additionally, the first character, Kung, when translated, means “training intensely” or “skillful work”. Translation of the second character, fu, refers to “time spent”. Together, Kung Fu may be translated as “time spent training hard” or “spending time on skillful work”. By this translation it is somewhat difficult to pin kung fu (time spent working hard) solely to martial arts (creative skill of fighting). Rather Kung Fu is referring to a skill or skills in a variety of subjects, and not just martial arts affiliated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kung (Gung) = Skillful work </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Fu = Time Spent</span></p>
<p align="CENTER"><span style="font-size: medium;">Kung Fu (Gung Fu) = Time Spent on Skillful Work</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER">Kung Fu</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">For instance, in today’s time when one speaks of Kung Fu, those involved immediately perceive it as martial arts—more specifically Chinese martial arts. However, this view contradicts the literal translation of kung fu as it predicates to a single subject. Kung fu is a meaning of achievement in a subject; be it in medicine, industry, mathematics, culinary or martial arts. It represents the training process that one had to go through—the strengthening of mind and body, the learning and the knowledge gained from it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Take for example one that acquires self-achievement in the knowledge of medicine through a long period of time; in comparison, there may be slight difference from one that acquired self-achievement in a martial art. Considering that both went through intense years and massive amounts of effort to reach their goal, it is difficult to deny that both carry kung fu skills. In this case you would say that the person has kung fu in medicine and the other person’s kung fu is in martial arts. </span></p>
<h2>Kung fu to Wushu</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The misuse of the word kung fu traces back to the misinterpretation of the word in Asian movie dubbings and subtitles. Since then Westerners often use it in its false pretense and is even defined the same way in the Oxford English Dictionary. Asia, even China, adopted the English definition of kung fu in the late twentieth century. The accurate term used that describes Chinese martial arts is Wu Shu. Wu, when translated, means “war”, and shu translates to “art”. Fully translated, wu shu means “the art of war” (which is also the title of Sun Tzu’s well known book).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Wu = War Shu = Art</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"> Wu Shu = the Art of War </span></p>
<h2>Chinese Martial art roots</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Much of the philosophy that Chinese martial arts follows is deeply rooted in eastern religious doctrines. The three that has the greatest impact in the evolution of Chinese martial arts are Daoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. What Chinese martial arts took from Daoism is the important teaching of the harmony between Yin and Yang. It is universal that for something to exist it will have an opposing force. Buddhism teaches the importance of all life and the need of one avoiding suffering through self-cultivation. Its use of practicing self-defense and learning make it an essential aspect in Chinese martial arts. </span></p>

<h2>Body Trinity</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">It also focuses on three aspects that make the human: the spirit, mind and body (some may refer to it as the “trinity”).</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> The body contains all that we are—all that we are made up of—the legs, arms, torso, etc. although it may be a healthy body it is an instrument that can be improved upon. The mind is what drives us to live the lives we live and is fed with knowledge and information. Feeding it positive information will have a parallel effect on the body and will greater ones existence. </span></p>
<p><strong>There is specific amount of time that it takes to achieve &#8220;kung fu&#8221; in Chinese arts. For some it may take a single decade, others it may take many! It all depends on your effort and dedication!</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Chinese Lion Dance is a celebratory dance usually enjoyed around Chinese New Year and other special occasions. Two dancers perform each lion, one as the head and fore-legs, and the other as the butt and hind-legs. The dancers both wear pants to match the lion’s fur, with one dancer under the oversized head, and the other bent over under a covering of “lion’s skin.” They then imitate lion like movements such as leaping, napping, scratching, and chasing their tail. The dance is usually accompanied by drums, cymbals, and a gong; playfully, and with lots of crowd involvement. This article will discuss the origin of the Chinese Lion dance and variances in style between the north and south.</p>
<h2><b>Origins</b></h2>
<p>Three legends exist in the Chinese culture that try and explain the origins of the Chinese lion. The first tells of a Monk who had a dream many evil spirits were about to attack China. The Monk prayed to the gods to send him a means of saving China from these evil spirits; his prayer led to a vision of a lion. Never having seen a lion before, the Monk created his own version of a lion from creatures including a dragon and unicorn – explaining why the Chinese lion does not resemble actual lions. The second legend tells of a visiting neighbor country who gave the Chinese Emperor a lion. The Emperor loved his new lion, but could not tame its’ aggressive nature. The Emperor commanded many civilians to the taming of the beast, but it was a Monk who was finally able to calm him. With pride, the Emperor showed off his new lion all around his country and stories of the incredible animal spread. The third legend tells of the animal coming down from heaven. Instead of having the natural traits of a lion, this lion was playful and enjoyed playing pranks on the country. At one point, the lion played a joke on the Emperor, enraging him so much that he cut off his head! A Chinese goddess witnessed the beheading and as a result tied his head back on with a magical red ribbon. She then gave the lion a mirror and a horn to drive away the evil spirits.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7458" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/24103556/chinese-lion-dance-florida-sifu-och.jpg" alt="chinese lion dance, chinese lion dance wedding, chinese wedding, lion dance wedding" width="300" height="216"></p>
<h2><b>North vs. South</b></h2>
<p>Despite coming from similar origins, Chinese lion dances vary greatly between the North and the South. The Northern lion dance is popular north of the Yangtze River. Performed by either one or two people, this lion is often smaller than the southern lion. Covered in tassels, this lion will act surprised, scared, and happy, while climbing, squatting, retreating and rolling. This lion is usually accompanied by a lion tamer, or warrior, who will lead the dance. The focus for the northern lion is on kindness and dexterity. The southern lion, also called the walking lion, is most popular in the Lingnan area of China. These lion dances are more athletic, incorporating jumps, moves, and attacks. The lion will progress through 8 stages of being: happy, sad, joyous, moving, resisting, surprising, and suspicion. Both lions, however, are rich in color and energetic movements.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion </b></p>
<p>Today the Chinese Lion Dance is performed by martial artists all over the world, for a myriad of occasions. At Sifu Och Wing Chun, our martial artists practice the dance and have performed for many different audiences. You may see a Chinese Lion at a wedding, a grand opening, or even a birthday party. Significance of the lion will vary between individuals, with some believing in the lion as a great source of fortune and good luck. No matter what the occasion, the lion never fails to bring smiles and good cheer to those around him.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="LEFT">The lines between eastern cultures many times become blurred when looking from the western side. Food, music, clothing, etc, can all seem to run together to the uneducated eye. One distinction to make involves&nbsp;the difference between the Japanese Ninja versus Chinese Assassins. Two very rooted aspects of Japan and China&#8217;s history, and yet so different. I will seek to clarify the distinctions here by touching on the history and training these two groups.</p>
<h2 align="LEFT">Ninja Versus Chinese Assassins &#8211; The History</h2>
<h3 align="LEFT">Japan</h3>
<p align="LEFT">Between the years 600-900 A.D. the skills needed to form the Ninja first began to develop. The first “official” Ninja school seems to have come about in the 12th&nbsp;century. Daisuke, a disgraced Samurai, met Kain Doshi in the Southwest Honshu mountains. Kain was a chinese warrior-monk who, with Daisuke&#8217;s help, created the art of Ninjutsu. It was Daisukes descendants that later created the first Ninjutsu school for formal training. The art then reached it&#8217;s peak during the years of 1330-1660 A.D. due to the many feuds with warring Samurai.</p>
<h3 align="LEFT">China</h3>
<p align="LEFT">Looking at the <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/about-sifu-och-wing-chun/wing-chun-kung-fu-history/history-chinese-assassins-espionage/">history of&nbsp;Chinese Assassins</a>&nbsp;gives you another perspective. Chinese assassins had no formal association or school like Japanese Assassins (Ninja). The Chinese Assassins Corp in the early 1900&#8217;s is not included because this was more an anarchist group than a martial art foundation. Chinese Assassins made marks in history—not by what they trained, but by their loyalty. This loyalty went to such extremes that their actions were burned in the annals of history from that moment on. One such story includes&nbsp;that of the midget Yao Li, who stood no higher than 4 feet tall. To complete his mission he requested that his hand be cut off and his entire family killed.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Using these events as a cover story he was able to infiltrate the ranks of his target, Qing Ji, and swear allegiance to him. The moment to strike came as Qing Ji, poised his fleet to attack his enemy, King Helu. Qing Ji stood atop his ship&#8217;s deck with Yao Li at his side. Seeing his moment Yao Li thrust his spear into the back of Yao Li. After completing his mission Yao Li committed suicide.&nbsp;He had disgraced himself with mutilation, by having his family killed, and through the betrayal of Qing Ji.</p>
<h2 align="LEFT">Training</h2>
<h3 align="LEFT">Ninja</h3>
<p align="LEFT">The birth of the Ninja came as a counter to the traditional Samurai and Bushido code. The Samurai, through their code, believed in honor and loyalty to family. Bushido was more to the Samurai than just a set of rules. Interwoven in their very person, it dictated their actions. To break this code meant&nbsp;to bring shame and dishonor to ones family and line. The Ninja capitalized on this instead of taking the Samurai head on, attacked them at their weakest. Their training focused on stealth, deceit, and guerrilla warfare. To the Samurai this type of behavior was shameful, but to the Ninja this didn&#8217;t matter. The goal was to accomplish the mission by whatever means necessary.</p>
<h3 align="LEFT">Chinese Assassins</h3>
<p align="LEFT">Since the Chinese Assassins had no formal coalition, there existed&nbsp;no common skills either learned or taught. Each individual account tells of different skills used each time. The story of Nie Zheng as opposed to that of Yu Rang. Nie Zheng got&nbsp;recruited based on his martial arts skill. After completing a commitment to his mother he simply walked into his target&#8217;s, Xia Lei, residence and cut down everyone in his path. Minister Yu Rang however went to more drastic measures. Hoping to avenge his Earl, Zhi Zao, he attempted twice to assassinate Xia Lei.</p>
<p align="LEFT">After the first attempt working as a servant in the lavatory failed, Zao had to take on a disguise. So fierce was his loyalty that he not only scarred his face horrifically but swallowed burning coals to change his voice. Although he did not complete his mission, Xia Lei became&nbsp;moved by Zhi Zao&#8217;s devotion and allowed him to cut a piece of his fabric. After completing his mission in ceremony, Zhi committed suicide.</p>
<h2 align="LEFT">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p align="LEFT">Even though many distinctions exist&nbsp;between Ninja versus Chinese Assassins, common threads still exist. Both remain very deadly, and both&nbsp;played a key part in each individual country&#8217;s history. History is an important part in martial arts. Knowing the origin and purpose for which something originated&nbsp;helps you understand its use now. Don&#8217;t just seek to make your knowledge wide, let it run deep.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Do Karate and Wing Chun Share Origins? I am here to argue that they do, and that origin can be found through the White Crane Kung Fu System.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tag lines like Karate beats Wing Chun, Wing Chun is better than Karate, Karate vs Wing Chun, splatters the internet, are always pitted against one another. However, there seems to be a lack of discussion about their similarities amidst all this conflict regarding their differences. We in the martial arts community need to come together and stop fighting amongst ourselves to better help others. So lets begin to look at this question: Do Karate and Wing Chun Share Origins? I am here to argue that they do, and that origin is White Crane Kung Fu.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;padding-left: 30px"><em><strong>Writers note:</strong> All of the information recorded below is complied via the internet and word of mouth via instructors. With all of the variances in language and historical accounting there may still be conflict. As the writer I have done my best to streamline the knowledge I have gathered and pay respects to the appropriate Masters who&#8217;s work brought these to incredible arts to life.</em></p>
<p>To begin answering the question do Karate and Wing Chun share origins let us look at Wing Chun Kung Fu First. It was developed by Ng Mui, and Shaolin nun during the ancient Qing dynasty (1644-1917) in Southern China. Much of the martial arts history is a mix of legend and fact due to the monks living on the run from the Manchu Government seeking to destroy all opposition at that time. As the story goes, Ng Mui developed a system of short range combat with heavy influences from Crane Style Kung Fu. One only need watch the Crane style form and the similarities become easily visible. For example,Wing Chun&#8217;s Bui Jee, Palm strikes, and Tan Sao shapes as well as the stance immediately show themselves in the first form: San Zhan.&nbsp; Throughout the generations Wing Chun remained a secretive style and was used for assassinations due to its viciousness and effectiveness. Eventually this system was then passed down to Ip Man who then made it available to the rest of the world when he brought it to Hong Kong after leaving Foshan. Wing Chun is known for it&#8217;s direct and incredibly fast techniques. It uses structure and technique to overcome size and power by cutting angles or driving force back into the opponent. Due to its extensive and wide history Karate cannot be defined as easily.</p>
<p>Karate&#8217;s history is not so easily traced, due to the many styles and variations. However, in 1922, a man by the name of Funakoshi Gichin, later known as the “Father of Japanese Karate”, left Okinawa for Tokyo, Japan, to demonstrate his art to the Ministry of Education at the First National Athletic Exhibition. Funakoshi&#8217;s stunning performance led to governmental approval to include Karate in the University Education System. Combining the fighting techniques from Okinawa with the Budo, or “martial way”, he began teaching the art openly across Japan. His teaching was the key to opening the door for Karate&#8217;s international future. Karate&#8217;s many styles all have their own origins but there was a clear Chinese influence from the very beginning. One piece of the puzzle is in the name that was given to the original styles of Karate from Okinawa: Okinawa-te or Tode meaning “Chinese Hand.” It was later changed to “Karate-do” by an Okinawan Master which means “way of the empty hand.” So where did Karate come from and where does White Crane fit in?</p>
<p>Confirming the influence from Southern China, trade between Southern China and Okinawa during the early 1900&#8217;s was at a high. As a result of this trade Chinese Kung Fu was exposed and taught to many the island of Okinawan and Mainland Japanese. So sought after were these chinese techniques that many martial artists would journey to China for extended periods of time. Often presumed dead, many would return as masters in the style of Kung Fu they had trained. Three main schools emerged when these techniques were organized by local masters;Naha-te, Tomari-te, and Shuri-te, all located in Okinawa. From Naha-te came Grandmaster Kanryo Higaonna (or Higashionna in the original Okinawan language) and from Shuri-te came To-De Sakugawa. both men had heavy training in Chinese arts.</p>
<p>Grandmaster Sakugawa trained under Chinese Master Kong Su Kung (or Kusanku in Japanese). From Master Kung he learned Chinese Boxing or Kenpo. From his knowledge in these styles three main styles emerged from his school in Shuri: Shotokan, Wado-Ryu, and Shito-Ryu Karate. So even though his style of Karate does originate from China it does not really contain White Crane. However, there is another line that needs to be followed through Grandmaster Kanryo Higaonna by which came Goju-Ryu Karate. Grandmaster Higaonna spent time in Fuzhou, China, in the 1870&#8217;s and trained under Ryu Ryu Ko, also known as Xie Xie Chongxiang, the founder Crying Crane Kung Fu and Grandmaster of White Crane Kung Fu.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>Writers Note</strong>: <em>Uechi-Ryu and Chito-Ryu are both also said to have aspects of White Crane. Due to the influence as far as lineage not being quite as clear and for the sake of simplicity I wanted to focus on Goju-Ryu here.</em></p>
<p>Now, obvious to say that White Crane is not the sole founder of Karate with so many styles of Kung Fu in China at that time. There was, however, a definite influence on at least Goju-Ryu Karate (and as mentioned above Uechi-Ryu and Chito-Ryu). It is easy to quote a lineage but what about the actual techniques? Are there actually similarities that can be seen between Karate and White Crane? Yes, one very clear example is in a form called Sachin or San Zhan. The movements and similarities between the forms can actually been seen here in this video Sanchin Form Comparison.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="comparitive karate san chiem ( sanchin ) San zhan" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mWh-uhw4C9s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>So in conclusion, I believe it is safe to say that some styles of Karate were definitely influenced by White Crane Kung Fu. Thereby solidifying Karate as a cousin of Wing Chun (albeit a very distant one). A further study could be done on concepts that overlap from the four mentioned styles: Goju-Ryu, Ueji-Ryu, Chito-Ryu, and Wing Chun. But, I will leave that to you the reader as a challenge. As you continue your martial art journey don&#8217;t seek out conflict but look to find harmony wherever possible.</p>
<h3>Editors Closing Thoughts</h3>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that what martial arts is about? Making yourself better and working together with those around you. Are we prepared to defend ourselves should trouble arise? Of course, but whether you train Karate, Wing Chun, or any other system we should be seeking to common ground. As martial arts brothers and sisters we should seek help those around us!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>We're frequently asked whether there is a difference between Ip Man kung fu and Sifu Och Wing Chun. The short answer is no. But your choice of Sifu matters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Frequently, the question is raised as to&nbsp;whether a difference between Ip Man kung fu and Sifu Och Wing Chun exists. The short answer remains&nbsp;no. There <em>is,</em> however, a difference in Wing Chun Sifu&#8217;s and what they know, understand or can apply from Ip Man. My personal goal includes&nbsp;understanding, training, and certification under, these different lineages from Ip Man. I do this to get a greater understanding of the Wing Chun system. It has taken to this point in my life so far, but I am now appointed the position of Southeastern USA Regional Director of the <a href="http://www.worldvingtsun.com/schools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Ving Tsun Association for the America&#8217;s</a>.</p>
<h2>Genuine Sifu&nbsp;Lineages&nbsp;in Wing Chun</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m also&nbsp;certified as a Black Gold Sash Sifu by Masters under Ip Chun, Ip Ching, Simin Lau and Moy Yat. All of these great men trained <em>directly</em> with Ip Man. Over the past 4 years I have made efforts to train under Grandmasters and Master&#8217;s from the Wong Shun Leung Lineage of Ip Man Wing Chun. This includes&nbsp;Grandmaster David Peterson who has helped me make great strides in this area.</p>
<p>So, no, there&#8217;s no appreciable difference between Ip Man kung fu and modern Wing Chun under a well-trained Sifu. For me, it&#8217;s about fully understanding Ip Man&#8217;s vision. It works with&nbsp;what he left, through all of the eyes and experiences of those he taught most. That is my goal and the goal I have for teaching my Wing Chun students. I want a&nbsp;fuller understanding of <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/ip-man/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ip Man Wing Chun Kung Fu</a>.&nbsp;I find that I can draw&nbsp;this from each branch that came from this amazing man. This way I can&nbsp;better appreciate and practice&nbsp;his dedication to the art. I&nbsp;hope to&nbsp;reflect his vision and teachings through each student and person that I teach and pass along&nbsp;these skills along to others.</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/bowing-martial-arts/">Bowing in the Martial Arts: A Necessary Element Misunderstood</a> appeared first on <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com">Sifu Och Wing Chun</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though bowing is not a typical way of displaying respect in American culture, anyone who has trained in just about any martial art will see the practitioners bowing at various times throughout the training session. But why are they bowing? Some people may not understand the&nbsp;meaning of bowing in the martial arts. Is it a sign of subservience? Inferiority? Self-deprecation? NO!</p>
<p>Bowing is anything but a gesture by one person saying that he or she is below the other! If this were the purpose of bowing, then bowing would not be a mutual gesture between two people but rather a one-sided action. It is actually a great insult for one person to bow and then the other person to not acknowledge or return the gesture. Bowing is a sign of mutual respect and humility.</p>
<p>There are many times when a martial artist may bow. When one bows upon entering a Wing Chun kwoon (training area), they are not merely performing a training formality. They are demonstrating through a motion of their body that he or she respects the environment into which they are entering and the people with whom they are going to train. In the Sifu Och Wing Chun kwoon, a student will bow to the pictures of the elders of our <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/different-wing-chun-lineages-expanding-skill/">Wing Chun lineage</a> (Ip Man, Ip Chun, Ip Ching, Moy Yat, Simon Lau, and Dr. Master Nelson) as a sign of the high regard for their devotion, self-sacrifice and dedication to the training they gave so that we may have the opportunity to continue to learn the art of Wing Chun. The Sifu (teacher, father, master, mentor) of his own school should always be shown the greatest respect by his students because he is the living legacy of the Wing Chun lineage handing down&nbsp;his knowledge first-hand.</p>
<p>Students at Sifu Och Wing Chun will often stand inside the doorway to the kwoon, if they have seen that Sifu is already in the building, and will remain in a Wing Chun hand salute position until Sifu has seen them so they may exchange the traditional salute and bow to each other. The student shows respect to his Sifu, and his Sifu returns the gesture to his student demonstrating the respectful bond between student and teacher. The same bow and salute is done upon leaving the kwoon.</p>
<p>Bowing in the martial arts&nbsp;can also be used as a sign of thanks, as well as of respect. If Sifu or a Sihing (student of a higher rank) is teaching, demonstrating, or correcting you, the student will often initiate the Wing Chun hand salute and bow as a sign of appreciation for the personal time given to the student. Sifu or the Sihing always returns the gesture to the student.</p>
<p>If training partners are going to spar, do reaction drills/wrist against wrist training, or Chi Sao, the Wing Chun students will perform the Wing Chun salute and bow both before and after they have worked with each other. This is also used as a respectful gesture if one student accidentally causes another student a small injury, the offending student will show his regret for his infraction by using the Wing Chun salute and bowing to the partner. The gesture is returned by the other to show that all is forgiven and signal that respect is still shared between the two students.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most Branchs of Wing Chun Kuen, trace themselves to Master Ng Mui Si Tai, in some form or another. The story relates that, one day, Ng Mui’s practice was interrupted by a snake and a crane&nbsp;which were&nbsp;locked in combat. Ng Mui watched the snake and the crane and came to admire their fighting methods. Observing this, Ng Mui began to incorporate the unique strengths and tactics into her already well-developed martial art skills, creating a remarkable new method that eventually became Wing Chun.</p>
<h2>Continuing&nbsp;Ng Mui History via Oral Tradition</h2>
<p>At this point, Ng Mui history gets a bit more fuzzy and the oral and written traditions of Yuen Kay Shan and Cho Family picks up the story, telling that&nbsp;Ng Mui journeyed to Guangxi where she met Miu Shin. She accepted Miu as a student, passing on to him her refined boxing methods. Miu Shin than mixed Ng Mui’s Bak Hok Kuen, with the snake boxing methods he already practiced and created the style which would eventually be called Wing Chun, after Yim Yee’s daughter.</p>
<p>Ng Mui renamed her Dragon-Tiger system to Mui Fa Pai. Today, there are many versions of this style, with many names of this concave chest postured (crouched posture) Dragon-Tiger system. The Mui Fa fighting system is nearly identical to sister arts like those of Bak Mei, Lung Ying, Southern Praying Mantis, Bak Fu, and later Yan Kun Moon. These sister system utilize the concept of being very aggressive from the best possible defensive posture (crouched posture). Not all of Ng Mui&#8217;s teachings were centered on offensive abilities. Some of her students were taught counter-fighting principles. Ng Mui instructed Fong Weng Chun (a male student) to specialize in the two animal systems known as the Weng Chun Dein Fu-Hok Sheong Ying. Most Fong clansman preferred the Crane techniques. Ng Mui also instructed Yim Yee Wing Chun (a female student and lineage holder of the Ip Man system) to specialize in the two animal fighting systems known as the Weng Chun Dein Sae&#8217;I-Hok Sheong Ying (the Enternal Springtime Hall&#8217;s Snake and Crane Form).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Who was Ip Man?</strong><br />
Wing Chun is popular thanks to Hollywood movies and its flashy style and no-nonsense self-defense techniques. But it&#8217;s difficult to hear Wing Chun without also having the name&nbsp;Ip Man&nbsp;mentioned in the same sentence.&nbsp;Ip Man (pronounced &#8220;Ip-Mun&#8221;)&nbsp;has a very fascinating history and was integral in the modern&nbsp;training and perfecting of this extreme system of self defense.&nbsp;In fact, China Airlines has taken the Ip Man Wing Chun system and made it required learning for terrorist self defense on all of its airlines.</p>
<p>Ip Man was born to Ng Shui and Ip Oi-dor, he was the third of four kids. &nbsp;He was born under a wealthy Foshan, Guangdong family. &nbsp; At the age of 7, he began his Wing Chun training under Chan Wah-shun though due to his old age he did most of his training under the second eldest student, Ng Chung-sok. &nbsp; Chan died three years later but upon his dying wish wanted Ng to continue teaching.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-5295" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/24102551/ip-man-kung-fu.jpg" alt="ip man wing chun kung fu martial arts" width="350" height="234" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/24102551/ip-man-kung-fu.jpg 350w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/24102551/ip-man-kung-fu-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" />At 16 years of age he moved to Hong Kong and attended St. Stephen&#8217;s College, which was a school for wealthy families. &nbsp;At this time their, he and his classmate once saw a foreign police officer striking a woman down. With no response when&nbsp;he asked what the woman had done or why the officer doesn&#8217;t just arrest her, he intervened. &nbsp; The officer tried to strike Ip Man but instead got knocked down&nbsp;quickly with&nbsp;a short succession of strikes. &nbsp;The classmate told a old man that lived in the same building of what happened and the moves that were used. &nbsp;Oddly the man wanted to speak to him, inviting him to his house. &nbsp;He asked Ip man what form of martial art he trained, Ip Man replied &#8220;the most powerful system in the World, Wing Chun!&#8221;. &nbsp;The old man asked to see his forms, after seeing them saying &#8220;not too great&#8221; and &#8220;poor&#8221;, this angered and upset Ip Man. &nbsp;The old man then asked if he knew Chi Sau (a form of wing chun close quarter reflex sparring), and he jumped at the chance to show this old man what he really could do. &nbsp;Within just a few strikes the old man defeated him over and over again without effort.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>This old man defeated Ip man, upset he ran from this encounter, only to find out something deeper and better.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/24102553/ip-man-bruce-lee-kung-fu.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-5298 alignright" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/24102553/ip-man-bruce-lee-kung-fu.jpg" alt="Ip Man Bruce Lee Chi Sau Wing Chun Kung Fu" width="274" height="420" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/24102553/ip-man-bruce-lee-kung-fu.jpg 274w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/24102553/ip-man-bruce-lee-kung-fu-196x300.jpg 196w" sizes="(max-width: 274px) 100vw, 274px" /></a>The next day while in the middle of a class at the college, his classmate told him that the old man wanted to see him. &nbsp;Ip Man refused, telling his friend he would never see that old man again under any circumstances. &nbsp;His classmate then told him that the old man was actually Leung Bik, the son of the teacher of Chan Wah-Shun. &nbsp;With this news, Ip Man&#8217;s entire face lit up, jumping out of his seat and running out of the classroom straight to Leung Bik.</p>
<p>Until the death of&nbsp;Leung Bik, he trained with him, even inviting him into his home to stay with him free of charge as he paid him for his Wing Chun knowledge.</p>
<h2>Ip Man Wing Chun Police Officer</h2>
<p>At the age of 24, Ip Man returned to Foshan and became a police officer teaching friends and relatives. &nbsp;He became famous for using his Wing Chun to stop every level of criminal and arresting them. &nbsp;During this time he knocked the chamber out of a old gun pointed at him with the trigger already pulled and half cocked, using just his fingers and the stress of the situation he dislodged the guns rotating chamber before it could fully turn and kill him.</p>
<p>There was once a Praying Mantis Master practitioner that came to Foshan challenging any who fight him, the martial arts Masters and Grandmasters&nbsp;came to Ip Man as he was in his prime and well known. &nbsp; A day was set for the fight and as it approached the Mantis instructor came to Ip&#8217;s place of work. &nbsp;He told him that he would crush Ip just like this pillar, as he spoke he looked at the concrete pillar closest to him and struck it, taking out a chunk of it with his fist. &nbsp; When the day of the fight arrived the two stood on top of a large parsons table, surround by spectators ordering food and drink. &nbsp;The moment came and the fight engaged, the Mantis practitioner came at Ip Man with a flowing barrage which was avoided Ip Man countered with his own attack knocking the Mantis practitioner backwards and off the fighting grounds crashing into a table breaking his ribs ending the fight.</p>
<p>He perfected his training by helping others and thinking of others. &nbsp;He used what his teacher taught him throughout his life, bringing real life experience to each technique.</p>
<h3>Ip Man Loses Everything</h3>
<p>During the Japanese War with China Ip Man lost most of his wealth and standing. &nbsp;Shortly after this, he&nbsp;left Foshan moving to&nbsp;Hong Kong in 1949 after the Chinese Communist Party took over.</p>
<p>After losing everything Ip Man took up opium, though in that time opium was as popular as cigarettes and had no known advertised adverse side effects. &nbsp;As time went on and his students found out that negative effects of opium and switched his addiction to Camel Cigarettes. Though poor after both the Japanese War took or destroyed everything he had, he taught students the martial art system that was passed down to him. &nbsp;With his students fighting and winning against many other systems and schools. &nbsp;He is most well known for teaching Bruce Lee, though he had many great student fighters that were not famous or publicly known. &nbsp;He found new life in the students he taught and the knowledge he passed down.</p>
<h3>Death of Ip Man</h3>
<p>Ip Man died on December 2nd 1972 in his housing unit at 149 Tung Choi Street in Hong Kong, from throat cancer from camel cigarettes. &nbsp;His death came only 7 months before Bruce Lee died.</p>
<p>The truth is after the Qing Dynasty sought out the destruction of the Shaolin Monks and their powerful martial arts systems most martial arts became outlawed and Wing Chun was no different, it went underground and was only passed from family member to family member. &nbsp;Originally developed by the Shaolin Temple to provide a new way to overthrow this invasive Dynasty by training rebel Chinese fighters. &nbsp;As time went on chinese martial arts forms became more aggressive and Wing Chun developed into a system of extreme aggressive close quarter combat that could be used by men, women and even children for personal protection. &nbsp; &nbsp;It was in the 1960’s when Ip Man, who is now considered the Grandmaster of Wing Chun, revived this art and brought it out into the public eye. &nbsp;The Hollywood legend Bruce lee is a famed student of his, Bruce Lee touted Ip Man as a amazing combat practitioner and teacher of the art.</p>
<p>Therefore, for all those of you looking for realistic self defense know that the system trained by rebels, created by Shaolin Monks that was passed down through family generations. &nbsp;Due to its extreme capability in close range combat it&nbsp;is now required training for all stuarists and flight attendents for terrorist self defense on China Airlines is available for your training and personal protection</p>
<p>Ip Man&nbsp;has been credited as the greatest Kung Fu Master of the century by many famed magazines and top practitioners of our time.</p>
<p>You should make it a point to be trained at a place where there is a direct link to the Ip Man lineage, our center is just that place. Call today for more information on the Wing Chun Kung Fu system under the Great Grandmaster Ip Man 863.800.0171.</p>

As the New People&#8217;s Republic of China (communist) became more active in the role of re-creating a sport like martial art that was more aesthetically pleasing to the eye style of what we now know as modern Wushu. The New People&#8217;s Republic of China wished to have a image of pleasant view to foreigner’s, while improving the physical prowess of those chinese practitioners that wished to take up the art. Wushu is better known as a acrobatic or gymnastic like kung fu that demonstrates the more fancy and artistic portions of Long Fist Kung Fu. The practical applications and techniques that are present in Taizu Changquan Long Fist style of Emperor Taizu were supposedly removed and separated into sanshou and sanda sport fighting/sparring competitions.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you do a jump kick, and you teach the purpose on how to &#8220;commercial martial arts someone out with it&#8221; while showing the 100% full original war/street purpose, I applaud you. If you throw weapons, but you do it because you&#8217;re throwing them through an opponent I applaud you. I applaud any and all men and women who teach or seek out such a teacher, that want to instruct them in the &#8220;original ways&#8221; to survive using a traditional martial art. I also applaud and respect those who are truthful about their teachings and tell a prospective student that by no means will the fancy move they are learning or that throwing or twirling a weapon in the air or around your fingers works on the street, but instead telling them, &#8220;Hey, it&#8217;s fun isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>To all of you out there who train hard through respect, honor and dedication I bow to you and ask for more commercial martial arts. God knows we need it.&nbsp; We need commercial martial arts&nbsp;more support for all truth bringers within the martial arts from both sides of the fence.</p>
<p>It takes a real hardcore person with a passion to want it, search for the purpose behind it and to learn ALL of it, asking what every moves purpose was for survival.&nbsp; Original martial arts are not easy and not fast food, they are “Kung Fu”.&nbsp; Take the Original Karate from Okinawa Japan, Muay Thai from Thailand, Taekwondo from Korea, Brazilian JiuJitsu from Brazil and in its Original Art form its all “Kung Fu”.</p>
<p>No not because I&#8217;m claiming they all came from Kung Fu!&nbsp; No its because&nbsp; Kung Fu means Time, Dedication and Hardwork and are you not then doing Kung Fu when you practice and teach your style?&nbsp; I bet you didn&#8217;t realize we were Kung Fu brother&#8217;s did you?&nbsp; Well we are so accept it!</p>
<p>So thus commercial martial arts if we are brothers in the art of survival, should we not support one another?&nbsp; We are not rivals we are family, and we train towards the safety and protection of the ones we love.&nbsp; The majority of individuals don&#8217;t want to push there body for years under rigorous training that bruises the body, toughens the mind and makes one see through the fancy maneuvers of commercial martial arts Hollywood film drama.&nbsp; Many want to be Bruce Lee without the hard work of Bruce Lee.&nbsp; A body and mind filled with purpose doesn&#8217;t need to put down another art.&nbsp; Instead of fake or misleading information or techniques. There are many school which have commercial martial arts. Allow the minds of others to become purposeful otherwise they are like sheep and unfortunately they will not see past the hair in their eyes. Stay alert, relaxed and poised on the results at hand, you will succeed you are purpose driven.</p>
<p>For our school with traditions of honor, respect, Chinese cultural heritage are all encompassed within the art of Wing Chun.&nbsp; Wing Chun is my style of choice just like yours may be another, but we are family in one mindset, self preservation and the preservation of others.&nbsp; More than just kicking and punching Wing Chun for me and those I teach is an art where students can find and grow in the original intentions of their previous masters.&nbsp; An enlightenment through reality based survival and increasing endurance and history.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No traditional martial art, no matter what its origins, had fancy and ineffective moves. It was created for survival and for the quickest and deadliest moves for battle in that culture, terrain, and for the immediate&nbsp;enemy.&nbsp;<span class="st">Traditional martial arts training refers to training in a martial art that is rooted in the tenets set forth by the original master of the art.</span> There were no triple somersaults, no throwing and spinning of weapons in the air, as this would cause instant death on the battlefield.</p>

<p>For the personal goals of the student even a traditional martial art school that has minimal reality effective moves in it could still meet the needs of the student.&nbsp; Especially if this student is wanting to learn slow paced techniques for stress management, fancy or flashy that have the&nbsp; impression of traditional martial art.&nbsp; These types of schools seek to boost confidence without the reality, pounding and harsh training related to the true intentions of their original traditional martial art.&nbsp; I have no problem with martial art facilities that teach these techniques as everyone is not looking for reality or combat training.&nbsp; Though I do take up an accord against ones that tell prospective students they teach self defense when in truth they hardly scratch the surface.&nbsp; In order to get that student to join they tell them whatever they want to hear and show a few &#8220;effective movements&#8221;&nbsp; though once the student joins they are taken for a ride.&nbsp; This gives people the false confidence and the impression that they know and can use real life saving techniques where in reality these techniques could get them killed.&nbsp; Thus honesty and respect are big concerns when it comes to practical application.</p>
<p>Original and traditional martial art instructors that show their arts original combative intent have not taken the road most traveled but rather have decided to make and teach you without compromise.&nbsp; The main stream of commercialized techniques and skills taught in schools can string a student through hoops instead of practical application.</p>
<p>After talking with many instructors of various schools the conclusion most have come to is that they truly believe that the student couldn&#8217;t handle real training.&nbsp; Many have even said that speaking about the harshness of a street fight, knife attack or rape situation would lose them more money than make them.&nbsp; Thus they should be fed fancy moves, false confidence and almost no practical street purpose and weapons that fly in the air only to be caught and spun on wrists and fingers.</p>
<p>I wish to disagree with many of these practices and schools but unfortunately I have seen these schools fill there classes with hundreds of students.&nbsp; None of these students ever asking or questioning the logic in this type of training.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most people want easy answers and to be told they are hardcore.&nbsp; No matter what your style, once you start to train students in the original arts intent, it is extremely hard to keep all those interested.</p>

<p>Ip Man fact, a blockbuster from China that hit that the global cinemas and the martial arts world by storm. An instant cult film among martial artists with fight scenes so exhilarating it makes anyone want to take up Wing Chun. But how much of the film is historically accurate and how much is Hollywood imagination?</p>
<p>In the film Ip Man fact is seen teaching an entire cotton mill of workers Wing Chun. In actuality Ip Man taught only a small group of students, mostly the children of the mill workers, in the back of the mill for around a year. Ip Man fact did not charge fees for his classes and there was believed to be around 6 consistent students. One of his students, Chow Guang Yiu, was the son of the mill owner and fabled to have the most potential. However, he later quit Wing Chun and martial arts all together instead choosing to follow in commerce. &nbsp; &nbsp;Ip Man never worked in a coal mine, as the movie portrayed. During the Japanese Occupation he was a well respected police officer. During his time in the police force, the incident where Ip Man broke a gun really did happen only a thief was holding the gun instead of a fellow officer as the film portrayed. As some legends would have it, Ip Man broke the bullet chamber of the gun with sheer finger strength.</p>
<p>The climatic battle between Ip Man and General Miura was made up for Hollywood audiences too. We should remember through that the movie Ip Man was meant for entertainment. A certain creative license is taken to exaggerate and speed up events to keep an audience interested. Like the Bruce Lee movies that proceeded it the Ip Man fact movies promote and popularize Wing Chun Kung Fu to the masses. Ip Man’s son Ip Chun was an on set advisor to the film. He was pleased with the portrayal of his fathers’ life and struggles.</p>
<p>The film followed an authentic timeline of Ip Man’s life. His beginnings in a wealthily childhood, escape from Communism and the Japanese occupation. Overall the film captured the essence of Ip Man fact as a great fighter, humble, courteous and a faithful practitioner of the ancient Chinese arts in tradition and honor.</p>
<p>Ip Man Fact or Fiction, Ip Man&#8217;s life was fact and the courses of the events throughout his life and use of Wing Chun to defend and protect are all true.&nbsp; How those events are interpreted by Hollywood may be adjusted but the man you must look at the facts of his life.</p>
<p>The movie is directed by Wilson Yip with the battle scenes choreographed by Sammo Hung. Donnie Yen, who portrayed Ip Man fact, had never taken Wing Chun before this role! Donnie Yen approached Wing Chun like skilled game of chess, countering your opponents move as you move in. To get a feel for the role as Ip Man Donnie Yen looked at the nature of the film. Taking place in waring and pre-war times Wing Chun is a very practical, grounded style. Each move and fight took on those elements. No wires or swanky acrobatics were needed to demonstrate the realistic power and effectiveness of Wing Chun.</p>
