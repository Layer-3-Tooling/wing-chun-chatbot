										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to teaching children anything it can be either a complete drag, or the most fun you will have the whole day. Your attitude will determine whether or not the clock will slowly inch it&#8217;s way to the next minute or run out before you realize class is done. I will explain here in Afterschool Kung Fu Fun the three &#8216;E&#8217;s&nbsp; to actually enjoy teaching a kids class no matter the age.</p>
<h2>Afterschool Kung Fu Fun</h2>
<h3>Establish Discipline</h3>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7990 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103920/Lakeland-preschool-little-kids-martial-arts-kickboxing-karate-kung-fu-dad-and-me-300x216.jpg" alt="Lakeland little lions kids preschool martial arts kickboxing karate kung fu ages 3 - 5 years old" width="300" height="216">The first thing that must be done is to establish a line of discipline with the student&#8217;s. Without discipline there will be utter chaos in the class. No matter how fun the class is there will always be some sort of disruption. In my article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/afterschool-martial-arts-showing-you-care/">Afterschool Martial Arts: Showing You Care</a> I explain in details a few details about establishing discipline. Understanding the line between fear and respect is crucial. Contrary to belief you cannot force someone to respect you. You can make them act a certain which may be perceived as respect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Respect is only achieved when the student&#8217;s know that you truly care about them. &#8220;People don&#8217;t care how much you know, until they know how much you care.&#8221; This is a phrase I live by. Before class starts I try to speak to as many of them as possible. I can build individual relationships with them and they can connect with me. We build trust and respect this way.</p>
<h3>Embrace Your Inner Kid</h3>
<p>Once you have established your discipline your class will go much smoother than without. A focused energy rises in the class when discipline is held across the room. You must capitalize on this energy. To use it you must embrace your inner child. If your 12 year old self were to be in this class what would make it fun? Answer that question over and over and you will find you are making new and exciting ways to do drills. You will find yourself looking forward to class. It becomes a chance to really have fun with your class.</p>
<p>By &#8220;becoming a kid&#8221; again you&#8217;ll see that you have the ability to take the same workouts and put a new spin one them that the kids will love. A perfect example is around Christmas time. At Sifu Och Wing Chun we have the kids to military crawl for part of the warm. The spin I tell them is that they are the Grinch and they have to sneak through the house without getting caught. Another fun warm up spin is something I call &#8220;ninja mode&#8221;. The students pretend to be ninjas while I give them instructions. Whether it is running quietly or jumping to avoid the incoming &#8220;sword&#8221;. They are able to get a good workout hidden under the guise of pretend.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7211 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/24103305/lakeland-kids-martial-arts-classes-afterschool-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu-300x216.jpg" alt="lakeland kids martial arts, martial arts, kids, martial art kids, kids classes, kids martial arts, lakeland, florida, fl" width="300" height="216"></p>
<h3>Explain Quickly</h3>
<p>The last thing that must be done is crucial. You must learn to be efficient with your explanations. Since their young minds have trouble focusing you must be potent with your talks. Clear and concise are your best friends. If you are able to explain techniques quickly you can spend more time drilling, working on their focus and persistence. Long explanations can also wear them out. While you don&#8217;t want to skimp on good info you have to find the balance or their little legs won&#8217;t be able to handle standing still for too long.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>To wrap things up. Three keys to having a good kids class: Establish discipline, Embrace your inner kid, and Explain quickly. If you can put all of these things together you will really enjoy teaching your kids class no matter the age.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Black Belt Kids should children receive Black Belts?</h1>
<p><a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/black-belt-kids/kids-black-belt-ranking-florida/" rel="attachment wp-att-8827"><img decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8827 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/24104458/kids-black-belt-ranking-florida-171x300.jpg" alt="black belt kids, kids black belt, kids, black belt, martial arts, karate, kung fu, wing chun" width="171" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/24104458/kids-black-belt-ranking-florida-171x300.jpg 171w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/24104458/kids-black-belt-ranking-florida.jpg 205w" sizes="(max-width: 171px) 100vw, 171px" /></a>We don&#8217;t believe in Black Belt kids, but we do believe in building the Black Belt Kid mentality. &nbsp;We feel much like college and advanced learning a Black Belt is meant for a matured mind and body in the martial arts.</p>
<p>But despite our opinions Black Belt kids happen more and more every year. &nbsp;Some call them McDojo&#8217;s, giving kids (some under 14 years old) black belt level within a short period of time, all to get them to stay and parents to keep paying. &nbsp;Of course parents and children are led to believe that the martial art instructor and staff are uplifting their child a through earned achievement.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>So where do you stand? &nbsp;Should your child become a Black Belt Kid? &nbsp;Or is your child already a Black Belt Kid?</strong></span></p>
<p>With after school programs having children start as young as 5 and within a few years achieving a Black Belt something that use to be reserved for elite adults. Training over years and proving everything they had to learn against grow men. With more and more schools opening up and ranking children faster to keep them and the parents happy, where does it end.</p>
<h2>Ranking is not about color, but capability</h2>
<p><a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/black-belt-kids/kids-black-belt-ranking-martial-arts-karate-kung-fu/" rel="attachment wp-att-8830"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8830" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/24104500/kids-black-belt-ranking-martial-arts-karate-kung-fu-171x300.jpg" alt="martial art, kids, kids black belt, black belt kids, " width="171" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/24104500/kids-black-belt-ranking-martial-arts-karate-kung-fu-171x300.jpg 171w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/24104500/kids-black-belt-ranking-martial-arts-karate-kung-fu.jpg 205w" sizes="(max-width: 171px) 100vw, 171px" /></a>THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, ranking for our school is hard to achieve, must be earned and is not about color. We believe ranking should be about skill and attitude built &amp; achieved. &nbsp;It’s always nice to get a new belt, a symbol of achievement. Many years ago BLACK BELT was a Title held Like a Masters Degree. Now children are just given black belts. Can they stop an adult attacker? or a Larger Bully? -OR- Did they receive the promise of a Black Belt to keep you paying &amp; them coming?</p>
<p>We talk to parents weekly who tell us that their child can’t protect themselves but the have or are about to achieve their Black Belt. So what is it worth then? What happens when that symbol is given out easily, it cheapen’s it.</p>
<p><a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/kung-fu-kids-keeping-your-kids-engaged/">PARENTS &amp; CHILDREN</a> Not realizing that the reason a Black Belt is revered is because of the skill, attitude, focus and determination it took to achieve. WE BELIEVE A BLACK BELT SHOULD BE A SYMBOL OF A LIFE CHANGE &amp; ACCOMPLISHMENT. NOT A CHILD&#8217;S TOY TO WANT, AND YOU TO BUY YOUR WAY THROUGH.</p>
<h2>Belt Colors &amp; different Schools</h2>
<p>We at SIFU OCH WING CHUN believe that lasting skill is taught daily, not because of a black belt promise. But the life skills taught and honed by teachers who give their all. Parents who don’t let their kids quit and students who do their best everyday. &nbsp;If your child wanted to quit Elementary School would you let them? <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/cuts-collisions-crying-tips-for-your-kids-program/">Some kids want to quit whats hard</a>, what they aren&#8217;t immediately good at. &nbsp;Will you let your child quit before they have truly achieved?</p>
<p>Our program here at Sifu Och Wing Chun doesn&#8217;t believes in having a child earn a black belt. &nbsp;We provide a clear way for children to make their way through our young children&#8217;s class and move smoothly into our teen and adult classes. A Black Belt or in our case since we train Wing Chun Kung Fu, a Black Sash is something that must not be taken lightly.</p>
<h2>OUR MARTIAL ARTS SCHOOLS BELIEF</h2>
<p><a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/black-belt-kids/black-belt-kids-ranking-martial-arts-karate-kung-fu/" rel="attachment wp-att-8832"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-8832 alignright" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/24104501/black-belt-kids-ranking-martial-arts-karate-kung-fu-300x216.jpg" alt="black belt kids, black belt, kids, ranking, martial arts, karate, kung fu" width="300" height="216"></a>We don&#8217;t believe in Black Belt Kids, we don&#8217;t believe in handing out ranks.</p>
<p><strong>We believe a Black Belt like a going to college, it needs a mature mind and body to achieve. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Instead of focusing on the belt rank, we focus on the life skills they are achieving and who they are becoming as an individual. &nbsp;Will they make good choices or bad choices in life? &nbsp;Will you hope they do or train them to do so? &nbsp;We believe these LIFE SKILLS are more important then the focus on a BLACK BELT. &nbsp;For us a BLACK BELT is a level of physical, mental, and emotional skill that as an adult we are mature enough to handle and gain the most from.</p>
<p>A child may be in the excelled learning program but it doesn&#8217;t mean they have the same understanding you do about the World now. &nbsp;A child&#8217;s mind and body, their experience in the World and what they could achieve is what we aim to develop. &nbsp;Uplifting them every step of the way. &nbsp;We believe you earn what you train and what you prove you know. &nbsp;Sifu Och Wing Chun builds a childs self esteem, skill, and personal determination. &nbsp;All of this can uplift a child without giving them the false understanding of black belt ranking.</p>
<h2>Belt Rank signifies Growth and Understanding of Skill</h2>
<p>In our classes belt ranking signifies what you understand and what we can now give you to build on what you have already trained and shown you understand. &nbsp;You may not have Mastered it yet, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t give you time and training to do so while teaching you more!</p>
<p>Black Belt Kids is a child seeking a new goal, not understanding its significance? &nbsp;If a child&#8217;s only goal in sit is getting that Black Belt then what is it worth if you get it easily? Our program builds a child up, their self defense skills, focus, and learning how to achieve in life. So they can transition through each phase in life, growing with our program in to the older kids classes, teen and adult programs.</p>
<h2><strong>Your Opinion on Black Belt Kids Ranking</strong></h2>
<p>If your reading this tell us how you motivate your children in your program. &nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>How do you rank a child who is 5 years old looking to achieve and keep them going until they are an adult? &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>How do you get them to focus on more than just a belt? &nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>When do you believe its a good time to rank a person to Black Belt and why?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Do you have kids that are Black Belts, tell us if your opinion differs and why?</strong></span></p>
<p>Train with us. Achieve with us. Win with us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Little 5 year old Lyla approaches me cry, &#8220;Mr. Tim, can I tell you something?&#8221; &#8220;Yes Lyla, whats the matter?&#8221; &#8220;That kid over there hurt me.&#8221; &#8220;What Happened?&#8221; &#8220;We were running and he made me fall.&#8221; &#8220;Do you think he did it on purpose? &#8220;No.&#8221; &#8220;Ok well then get back to jogging.&#8221; &#8220;But my finger hurts so bad.&#8221; &#8220;Did you know Lyla, that I hurt my finger really bad once when it got caught in a door?&#8221; &#8220;No.&#8221; &#8220;Here let me show you the scar.&#8221; Lyla stops crying. &#8220;Ya it hurt pretty bad&#8230;&#8221;; (I explain full story). &#8220;Yep, got 4 stitches; whats your favorite warm up?&#8221; Lyla cheerfully chirps, &#8220;Zombie Crawls&#8221;! &#8220;Ok lets do Zombie Crawls; everybody, Zombie Crawls!&#8221; In this article, &#8220;Cuts, Collisions, Crying: Tips for Your Kids Program&#8221;, I will explain how I handle children who are &#8220;distraught&#8221; over an injury.</p>
<h2>Cuts, Collisions, Crying: Tips for Your Kids Program</h2>
<h3>Know Your Kids</h3>
<p>Knowing your enemy is the first step in gaining the upper hand to defeat them. Obviously our children in our programs are not our enemies. However, overcoming their distress is. To use the technique I will explain you must know and understand your children. In my previous articles&nbsp;<a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/kung-fu-kids-keeping-your-kids-engaged/">Kung Fu Kids: Keeping your Kids Engaged</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/lakeland-afterschool-and-summer-camp-fun/">Lakeland Afterschool and Summer Camp Fun</a>&nbsp;I briefly mention a few ways to engage your children but also how to connect with them. Listening to them and not just treating them like a &#8220;little kid that is misbehaving&#8221; is a big key. When I speak to them if there was a fight or bad behavior I help them rise to the occasion. I tell them they need to speak to me like an adult. I help them calm their emotions. If they are excited or crying I explain to them I can&#8217;t understand what they are saying. Doing this usually helps them focus in on me and speak clearly.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-8732 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/24104418/IMG_4412-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/24104418/IMG_4412-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/24104418/IMG_4412-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/24104418/IMG_4412-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/24104418/IMG_4412-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/24104418/IMG_4412.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>By doing so I have seen an increase in respect when it is my turn to say something. By listening to them and explaining to them they must speak to me clearly they know that I am listening. This gains their trust as I watch and learn how they think and communicate. Once problem at a time I gain a little more insight into the differences that each child has. Once I know how their brain works, what they like, dislike, etc., I can now employ one of my favorite techniques when they are overreacting to an injury&#8230;distraction and redirection.</p>
<h3>The Art of Distraction and Redirection</h3>
<p>When a child is hurt their emotional flux tends to be more dramatic then the pain actually calls for. This is typically rooted in the base need for attention to have someone help with the problem. As they grow however, they need to learn that crying is not the best way to get help. But by clearing communicating with an adult. This is not automatically learned however, it must be taught. There is a hurdle when it comes to teaching this though. That hurdle is that emotional wave mentioned earlier. When their emotions are high, it is near impossible to teach them anything let alone communicate. Distraction is the key to breaking that emotional wall you will encounter.</p>
<h4>Distraction</h4>
<p>One of the best ways I have found to &#8220;distract&#8221; the child is connect with them by referring to one of your own injuries. Shifting the focus off of something requires something new to focus on. By relating to them with your own injury they will tend to perk up to hear the story. They want to know what happened to Mr. Tim and his finger and how he got that scar. Once the wave has been calmed by interesting anecdote, their attention must be moved forward or they will relapse into the &#8220;pain&#8221; which was mostly in their mind.</p>
<h4>Redirection</h4>
<p>Redirection is the next key. By moving their focus on something positive, something they enjoy (preferably within the activity being done) their carefree mind will happily get distracted by the next thing. In the story I gave Lyla the option to pick the next warm up. Turns her brain completely away from her finger to &#8220;ooo, I get to pick the next one, which one do I like&#8221;. Once this is done they usually go about the day without remembering their finger at all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lakeland is a wonderful area for an Afterschool and Summer Camp Program. Our Afterschool program is right in the heart of the city in Downtown Lakeland. We can easily access many schools in the area and bring them back to a centralized location. Lakeland is also perfect for our Summer Camp due to its location. Since we are located in between Tampa and Orlando we have many options at our disposal. In this article we will go over some of our programs and activities for&nbsp;Lakeland Afterschool and Summer Camp Fun.</p>
<h2>Afterschool</h2>
<p>Our Afterschool program is a hybrid of martial arts and dance. Sifu Och Wing Chun and Just Dance Academy of Etiquette. We use our program to have a fun time with the students but to also instill good principles. During the school year the children are picked up from their locations and brought back to our studio in downtown Lakeland. Once they are have reached the location they start off with snack time immediately followed by homework. This part of our program is integrated with the parents. The parents clarify what they want to accomplish at this point. Whether the children need to focus on homework and not do any activities until they are done, or get as much done until either dance or martial arts.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-8724 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104411/IMG_4465-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104411/IMG_4465-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104411/IMG_4465-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104411/IMG_4465-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104411/IMG_4465-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104411/IMG_4465.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Following homework time the children have one of two things happening. They will either attend a hip hop\dance class or a martial art\self defense class. Both of the classes have a them of discipline. If discipline is not maintained then teaching anything to the children will be difficult if not impossible. Discipline is kept with a strict set of rules that are enforced but with love.</p>
<p>When a child acts out simply dishing out punishment is not enough. There must be an understanding of why the child is being punished. This is done by simply talking to the child before giving the punishment. The other side of the coin is a repeat offender who knows better or time constraint. In these cases it is acceptable to simply give the punishment needed. Positive reinforcement just as important however. Whenever a child accomplishes something or does follow the rules well, it should be met with an high amount of praise. A sense of pride is instilled and a desire to obey is created and supported.</p>
<h2>Summer Camp</h2>
<p>Summer camp follows the same schedule as our Afterschool program in the afternoons. The mornings is where the fun happens. Two groups are used at all times. &#8220;Big Kids&#8221; and &#8220;Little Kids&#8221; are the two groups. The ages are cut off at 8. With two groups being active we have the freedom to rotate activities and allow parents to decide what to do.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8521" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/24104250/martial-arts-summer-camp-lakeland-fl-wing-chun-kung-fu.jpg" alt="summer camps lakeland martial-arts-summer-camp-lakeland-fl-wing-chun-kung-fu" width="300" height="216"></p>
<p>For example; if we take Big Kids to Mosi one day and the Little Kids swimming. The parent of a child might not have the money or desire to have their child to go to Mosi. What we then do is move the child to the little kids group for the morning. This freedom give the parents a lot more flexibility without having to give up the Summer Camp day. At the end of the day the kids funnel back to the studio to do their martial arts or dance lessons just like during the school year.</p>
<p>This system give the kids consistency throughout the whole school year. Whether they are seeking to become a competitive dancer or prolific martial artist, they can continue their training year round. Take a look at our Kids Afterschool&nbsp;and <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/kids-martial-arts-classes/kids-summer-camps/">Summer Camp</a>&nbsp;to see what fun we have with out camp!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nobody likes a boring class. Whether its a college course, drivers ed, or martial arts for that matter, staying engaged is hard in a boring class. This is compounded when it comes to teaching kids. Their minds are already prone to wandering in the day to day activities. Focusing on training one task for an extend amount of time is one of the most difficult hurdles of martial arts teaching. So how do you overcome this problem without subjecting your art to then demon of distraction? We will cover a few ways to do that here in this article Kung Fu Kids: Keeping Your Kids Engaged.</p>
<h2>Kung Fu Kids: Keeping Your Kids Engaged</h2>
<h3>Relationships First</h3>
<p>In my previous article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/afterschool-martial-arts-showing-you-care/">&#8220;Afterschool Martial Arts: Showing You Care&#8221;</a>&nbsp;I cover some ways to make sure your children understand that you care about them. That is one of the most important things when it comes to their focus. For a student to stay focused on you they must have one of two things: fear or respect. Fear may give you short term results but can hurt their learning in the long run. My previous article helps address how to help cultivate that respect from the day to day of teaching a class.</p>
<p>Once that respect has been set in place your students will be much more keen on listening to you. However, this must be constantly worked on and reinforced. It is much easier to be a bit harder on your new student and then wain off of that. If you do not establish that line of mutual respect first then it will be very hard to make that up later.</p>
<p>One is the Alpha and one is the Beta. As their instructor, you are the Alpha. This must be established from day one. If the child at any point feels as though they have become the Alpha then you will struggle to maintain their respect.</p>
<h3>Mixing things up</h3>
<p>Now that we have gone over the base of relationships, lets get into an applicable drill.One of the tactics we employ at the Sifu Och Wing Chun <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/kids-martial-arts-classes/lakeland-after-school-martial-arts-program/">Afterschool</a> and <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/kids-martial-arts-classes/kids-summer-camps/">Summer Camp</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/kids-martial-arts-classes/kids-martial-arts/">kids martial art classes</a> is called Cycling. We cycle the same techniques over and over again through different drills. As an example, if you are teaching your kids a Tan Sao Punch you could mix it up 3 different ways.</p>
<p>First, have your kids practice the technique in the mirror. They will focus on shifting their weight properly as well as punching the same target every time they strike. Within that drill you shift their focus from their punches, to their weight, to their Tan hand. This allows you to continue drilling but gives them different focus points. By changing the focus points you have again &#8220;cycled&#8221; the drill within it self.</p>
<p>Second, have your kids use focus mitts to build power. Blasting through the mitt with as much power as possible. Again, cycling through different focus points to help them fully develop their technique can help their mind stay engaged.Whether it&#8217;s making sure they are striking with the correct portion of their fist or they are engaging their hips fully. Changing things small things helps keep things engaging.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-7967 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103903/lakeland-little-lions-classes.jpg" alt="lakeland little lions classes" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103903/lakeland-little-lions-classes.jpg 850w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103903/lakeland-little-lions-classes-800x534.jpg 800w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103903/lakeland-little-lions-classes-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103903/lakeland-little-lions-classes-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103903/lakeland-little-lions-classes-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Thirdly, applying that technique within a combo against an attack. If you throw a combo into the mix it not only keeps it engaging but also allows gives perspective. When they see the big picture it helps them understand why they are working on the that individual technique.</p>
<p>By cycling through these drills in a class we are able to accomplish two things. We are able to keep the kids engaged by not repeating the same drill for too long. But at the same time they are able to work on their focus within that drill because they are given those different focus points. As far as the actual time, that balance must be experimented with and adjust based on your kids. You will have to gage the class to accomplish this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;People don&#8217;t care what you know until they know that you care&#8221;. That statement has never been more true then when it comes to dealing with kids. Children these days have a serious struggle with staying focused. Lack of focused is compounded in a class setting. As an instructor we must take every advantage to maintain our student&#8217;s focus. One of the biggest ways to help them maintain their focus is helping them understand how much you really care about them. In this article, Afterschool Martial Arts: Showing You Care, I will go over some&nbsp;tips on&nbsp;how to accomplish that.</p>
<h2>Afterschool Martial Arts: Showing You Care</h2>
<h3>Mat Chats</h3>
<p>Mat chats are a great way to intentionally impart wisdom to the next generation. At the <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/kids-martial-arts-classes/lakeland-after-school-martial-arts-program/">Sifu Och Wing Chun and Just Dance Afterschool and Summer Camp Classes</a> we take 5-10 minutes every class to sit and talk to our students. Each month we go over new concepts to help them grow as people. This can range from peer pressure to manners. These mat chats are not lectures. They are a time to engage with your students and listen to their responses. Getting them to open up to you shows them that they can trust you. When you listen to their responses you are leading by example. By showing them how to listen respectfully they can see what it means be respectful.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7988" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103918/Lakeland-Little-Lions-preschool-martial-arts-kickboxing-karate-kung-fu-feature.jpg" alt="Little Lions preschool martial arts" width="580" height="330" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103918/Lakeland-Little-Lions-preschool-martial-arts-kickboxing-karate-kung-fu-feature.jpg 580w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103918/Lakeland-Little-Lions-preschool-martial-arts-kickboxing-karate-kung-fu-feature-400x228.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103918/Lakeland-Little-Lions-preschool-martial-arts-kickboxing-karate-kung-fu-feature-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></p>
<h3>Listening When Disciplining</h3>
<p>Many times I have seen, and experienced, instructors in martial arts and sports doing blind discipline. A child acts up and immediately they are jumped on and made to do some form of work out for a disciplinary action. Before moving forward let me confirm that discipline is key, without it classes are chaos and nothing is accomplished. However, maintaining discipline is a two sided coin. True discipline is achieved when the student is&nbsp;maintaining&nbsp;discipline out of respect, not fear. I accomplish this in my classes by taking the student&#8217;s aside that are acting up and talking to them.</p>
<p>When I have engaged a student I seek to explain to them my point of view. Helping them understand why I am pulling them out of class or off to the side. What I am trying to accomplish is to show the child that I have perceived a wrong has been committed. And then due to that perception something must be done about it. I then allow the child to explain himself. Allow him to share why he was acting up or not staying focused. Most of the time there is no good reason and proceed to explain why I must discipline the child. However, there are times where the child was not deserving of punishment.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7990" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103920/Lakeland-preschool-little-kids-martial-arts-kickboxing-karate-kung-fu-dad-and-me.jpg" alt="Lakeland little lions kids preschool martial arts kickboxing karate kung fu ages 3 - 5 years old" width="300" height="216"></p>
<h3>To Punish Or Not To Punish</h3>
<p>Many times when speaking to the children I have found that outside factors played a big role in their distraction or outburst. If they are having a hard time focusing on their training sometimes it leads back to family or school problems. In that scenario I have the chance to teach them another lesson. This can be anything from perseverance in a hard time to forgiving a friend for doing something wrong to them. In any case a punishment would have only hurt their growth.</p>
<p>Most of the time, unfortunately, the child is acting up because they simply have not learned discipline yet. In&nbsp;that is the case you must be consistent, firm, but caring in your punishment. If it is a repeat offender in the same day I will again take them aside and speak to them. If after I have spoken to them, and punished them multiple times then in might be time to speak to the parents about what you can do as a time to help with his discipline.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Children can be wonderful to teach. Their mind can absorb very quickly and they have a very high energy most of the time. That being said, your kids classes are what you make them. If you make them a time that the children feel safe and cared for, they are more likely to listen and enjoy your classes.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>People of all ages are susceptible to bullying, but why wait until after the fact to do something?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Children will always be susceptible to acts of bullying, but why wait until that happens? Don’t wait until your child’s already a victim of bullies, harassment, depression or a habit of disrespect. Enrolling your child in the martial arts under individuals like Sifu Och Wing Chun has the potential to solve the problem before it begins. Creating a proactive solution to the problem that so many face. Putting your child in martial arts has the ability to increase respect and self-esteem, and improve peer relationships. Why wait until your child is a victim?</p>
<h2>Respect and Self-esteem</h2>
<p>Sifu Och Wing Chun kung fu and other martial arts for kids can help increase respectful talk, and respectful behavior. This can go a long way in life and with teachers in the school system, making learning and education a more enjoyable experience for all involved. But fostering a sense of respect is no easy task and takes time, effort, and lots of parental involvement. If the child is only disciplined and in a structured environment once a week, it may take years to see change; however, if the parents are continuing the effort put forth in class, results may occur in as little as a few weeks.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7990" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103920/Lakeland-preschool-little-kids-martial-arts-kickboxing-karate-kung-fu-dad-and-me.jpg" alt="Lakeland little lions kids preschool martial arts kickboxing karate kung fu ages 3 - 5 years old" width="300" height="216"></p>
<p>Respect and self-esteem are two values that often influence one another. When the child is respectful to others, he or she is more likely to respect his or her self – encouraging good self-esteem. Having good self-esteem is imperative to warding off bullies. Bullying leads to a lack of self-esteem, but a lack of self-esteem may also lead to bullying. When the child’s self-esteem is low, they begin to believe what the bullies are saying about them and start to identify with that image. Children with higher self-esteem are more likely to disregard bullies, easily believing their words to be untruthful. In the martial arts, children are taught their worth and encouraged to build themselves up. Martial arts give children goals to set and achieve and, with the right school, instructors that mentor each child to reach their full potential.</p>
<h2>Peer Relationships</h2>
<p>Sometimes your child may be their own bully solution. By increasing their self worth they reduce depression and anxiety. Sifu Och Wing Chun can also help with their social skills which can help them to make new friends. When children are suffering with depression and anxiety, they are at a greater risk to become a victim of bullying. Physical activity of any kind has a positive effect on depression and anxiety, when that activity meets with the structure and discipline of martial arts the effect is twofold.</p>
<p>But on top of benefiting the child physically and mentally, the peer relationships that they make in class encourages good social development. Often times in school, certain children have a tendency to get left out. Either by the group as a whole or ostracized from different cliques. In a martial arts class, children work with everyone in the class as well as in groups and individually. When doing partner work the partners will switch up every round. This gives each child the opportunity to meet and make new friends as well as work with different body types. Simultaneously promoting social and martial arts skill.</p>
<h2>Choose Now-Why wait until your child is a victim?</h2>
<p>People of all ages are susceptible to bullying, but why wait until after the fact to do something? Most adults have learned to cope and deal with bullies, but it is usually after years of being bullied themselves. Enrolling your child in a martial art does not mean that they won’t get bullied. It does, however, ensure that they are better equipped to deal with it when it happens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span class="_5yl5">Importance of a Strong After School program</span></h2>
<p><span class="_5yl5"> Parents all over the United States rely on an after-school program to take care of their children while they are finishing their day at work or at home. With an increase in dual-income families and single parent homes, these after school programs have become a necessity for a vast number of families. This has created a great demand for after-school care programs; however, all programs are not created equal. Parents have many options to choose from in picking an after school program and the amount of time the child spends at that program makes it an incredibly important decision, so what makes a good program? </span></p>
<h2><span class="_5yl5">Sifu Och vs Other After-Care Programs </span></h2>
<p><span class="_5yl5">Most after school programs have a singular focus with only one program to offer. Our children have the opportunity to learn both martial arts and dance. Let&#8217;s face it: children have very short attention spans. The opportunity to attend two completely different aftercare programs every week allows for a greater ability for them to learn and enjoy themselves. The two skills of dance and martial arts in themselves are invaluable. The dance classes teach coordination, flexibility, and self-expression. While the martial arts classes teach children discipline, respect, and to defend themselves. As well, children in both classes will learn a number of skills that teachers cannot explicitly teach in the classroom. Some of the additional skills taught include: etiquette, manners, team building, organization, social interaction, and cleanliness. </span></p>
<h2><span class="_5yl5">Curriculum </span></h2>
<p><span class="_5yl5">Sifu Och Wing Chun and Just Dance offer a unique program curriculum that encourages both personal growth and learning. We place children into different classes based on age. The older children working on Wing Chun Monday&#8217;s and Wednesday&#8217;s while the younger children follow Just Dances program. On Tuesday&#8217;s and Thursday&#8217;s the older kids go to Just Dance and the younger ones do kickboxing. We offer kickboxing to the younger children instead of Wing Chun, as it is a little bit easier for them to comprehend and practice. In the Wing Chun classes, we teach children the same curriculum that adults learn throughout the week; including punch and kick defenses, forms, and combinations. The kickboxing classes incorporate a mixture of principles from Wing Chun, Karate, and Boxing all done in a kid friendly class. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7254" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/24103329/best-polk-county-summer-camp-girls-sifu-och-wing-chun.jpg" alt="best summer camp in lakealnd fl, best summer camp in lakeland florida, best summer camp, lakeland, fl, florida, sifu och wing chun, kung fu" width="300" height="216"></p>
<p><span class="_5yl5">The Just Dance classes teach dance from a variety of styles including: Ballroom, Ballet, and Hip Hop. Summer Camp is also offered along with the regular school year after-care. In summer camp kids will continue taking martial arts and dance. They will also participate in a plethora of activities to keep them busy. Activities range from museums to amusement parks to arts and crafts, and are all monitored by an attentive staff. </span></p>
<h2><span class="_5yl5">Lifelong Benefits </span></h2>
<p><span class="_5yl5">The benefits gained from our after school program reach beyond the immediate. They have the potential to greatly affect each child’s future. We give these children valuable time to be physically active and interact socially with their peers in a way that their school is unable to provide for them. Being active in the younger years has the potential to decrease the likelihood of various diseases and boosts immunity, allowing for a healthier future. It may also have the ability create fewer emotional and behavioral problems. At Sifu Och Wing Chun, our program also strives to instill good leadership qualities in the children. Rewarding leadership in students and encouraging success by positive reinforcement. An investment in your child&#8217;s future, is always worth the effort. This investment made early on will have lifelong physical and cognitive benefits, make sure it&#8217;s a good one.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The average parent will have many concerns when contemplating enrolling their child in a martial arts class. The top three questions I have encountered talking with parents about their learning a martial art are: Will my child be safe? Will they use techniques on their siblings or bully others? And at the root of it all, will these classes make my child violent? The last one is especially a concern among parents of children who are already showing violent tendencies, leaving parents wondering “will martial arts help or only make it worse?” In this article I will address the question: &#8220;Does Martial Arts Make Kids Violent?&#8221;</p>
<h2><b>Will my child be safe?</b></h2>
<p>In observing any martial arts class, once can generally expect to see aggressive and violent techniques. So why then would that be safe for a child? For starters, these techniques are usually performed on punching bags, target mitts, or in the air without an opponent. Before the child is even allowed to hit a punching bag, we teach the proper technique. The goal is to avoid any injury to their wrist in the execution. When the child moves on to working with partners when drilling techniques, punches are always pulled and they are not allowed to hit the face – as a general rule that many adults follow as well.</p>
<p>When it comes to one-on-one sparring, many schools don’t even allow their students to spar until the student achieves a certain rank and the instructor is confident in their ability to follow instructions. At this point, we require all students to wear gear that will usually cover the head, hands, and feet, with some styles including a chest guard, shin guards, elbow pads, and a mouth guard. Even with all of this padding, students are often instructed to keep contact light, with good technique praised over power.</p>
<h2><b>Will my child use techniques against their siblings or bully others?</b></h2>
<p>Another top concern of parents is that their child will start to use techniques on other children in order to bully them or exert power. This is a common problem throughout martial arts schools, and it is necessary for the instructor to address early on in the child’s training. Along with teaching martial arts techniques, it is the instructor’s job to explain when exactly to use these techniques. This part of the instructor’s job is sometimes overlooked, but is equally as important.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7209" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/24103302/kids-martial-arts-classes-after-school-program-sifu-och-wing-chun.jpg" alt="kids martial arts, lakeland, florida, fl, martial arts, kids, martial arts classes, afterschool, after school, lakeland after school program" width="300" height="216"></p>
<p>The child’s first instinct in a fight should never be to egg on and encourage the fight, but to deescalate. One of the first things that I learned was to put my hands up. This was a non-threatening semi guard combined with a&nbsp;verbal exclamation “I don’t want any trouble&#8221;. Your hands are up simply as a precaution. It needs to be explicitly taught to the child that fighting is always a last resort. To use only if there is a threat to the safety of themselves or another individual. We never fight over possessions. Children should learn that if they are being physically threatened over money, especially with a gun or knife, to give them the money.</p>
<h2><b>Will martial arts make my child violent?</b></h2>
<p>So will learning martial arts techniques ultimately encourage violent tendencies? To be honest, the answer to this question greatly depends on the martial arts school and the instructor. A good school will explain the situations in which to use their techniques. This helps to will cultivate a non-aggressive mentality in their students. When done right, children that do martial arts will actually have less violent tendencies than their peers. They will have a greater understanding of when, where, and how to use their defensive techniques.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The title of this article may seem like an odd question, but it is something everyone should ask themselves. This is only for their own benefit and health. Safety in this respect refers to the physical environment, cleanliness, and set up of the martial arts school. There are certain warning signs and things you should take note of. Not only should you observe when you looking for a school but even after you enroll.</p>
<p>So what should you be looking for when you enter a martial arts school to ensure that it is going to be a healthy place to train:</p>
<h2><u>Look at the physical arrangement of the studio</u></h2>
<p>Is the training area around anything that you could bump into, trip over, fall on, be pushed into, etc. (Chairs, weights, brooms, tables, training equipment, other students bags/gear?) A responsible martial arts school will have specified places for these items. They will also be sure that those items are kept there to ensure the safety of the students.</p>
<p>Are there mirrors in the studio? If so, are they far enough away to not cause injury? Most studios are going to have windows to let in light and to allow the public to be attracted to what is going on inside. However, all training should occur well away from any windows to avoid potential accidents.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1247" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/24101205/7.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="225" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/24101205/7.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/24101205/7-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<h2><i><u>Look at the training floor</u></i></h2>
<p>Wherever you will be doing your martial arts training, you need to be sure that the floor is going to be safe. Concrete floors, or floors covered with only a thin matting are a red alert that your safety may not be a high priority at the studio. If you were taken down, swept off your feet, or knocked down doing a technique, would you feel safe landing on the training floor? (Sifu Och Wing Chun has professional martial arts mats covering our training area so our</p>
<p>Also, does the floor look clean? If there are mats on the training floor, it is <u>essential</u> that the mats are cleaned with a hospital grade disinfectant on a regular basis. Martial arts mats can be breeding grounds for staphylococcus and other communicable skin diseases. (At Sifu Och Wing Chun we sweep and disinfect our floor, mats, and bathrooms a minimum of 2 times a week for the health and safety of our students.)</p>
<p>Use your nose and your eyes. Does the martial arts studio look or smell moldy or foul? Can you see dirt on the floor, can you smell garbage that needs to be taken out, are the bathrooms in a clean state? If you are in doubt about the cleanliness of the studio that you are looking to train in, ASK! Your safety should be as important to the owner of the martial arts school as it is to you! If you feel uncomfortable about anything when you visit a training studio, trust your gut and find a place that makes the safety of its students a top priority!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-7554 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/24103611/Learning-Ground-Game-Tactics-Wing-Chun-300x225.jpg" alt="Learning Ground Game Tactics in Wing Chun" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/24103611/Learning-Ground-Game-Tactics-Wing-Chun-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/24103611/Learning-Ground-Game-Tactics-Wing-Chun-768x576.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/24103611/Learning-Ground-Game-Tactics-Wing-Chun-400x300.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/24103611/Learning-Ground-Game-Tactics-Wing-Chun-600x450.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/24103611/Learning-Ground-Game-Tactics-Wing-Chun.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h2>Safe sparring</h2>
<p>As a side note, sparring also needs to be addressed.&nbsp; The area where sparring is done should be void of&nbsp; windows, concrete, or thin mats which could injure individuals. If they are are taken down, get swept, thrown, or fall these areas could cause serious damage. Halt training if the place you are at has hazards to you before they become a injury. Along with location you should also check equipment every time. The death of a martial artist is inactivity. That inactivity should never be because of an injury due to faulty equipment.</p>
<p>Just as your training requires discipline, so should your safety.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>All children can benefit from practicing the martial arts. The discipline, focus, and endurance gained will be an invaluable and impactful part of their childhood. The question is not necessarily how young is too young, but rather what is the best age to start my child.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every martial art school will refuse to train children under a certain age, but what age should that be? Some schools set a hard and fast number. Other schools base their choice on the individual. No instructor wants to waste his or her time with a student who is unable or unwilling to learn. Some argue that a child should wait until he or she can comprehend the information before beginning their training.&nbsp; Others argue that a child should learn discipline through martial arts as young as possible. So what is too young for martial arts?</p>
<h2>What Age is&nbsp;Too Young For Martial Arts?</h2>
<p>Children as young as two years old have been seen training and competing in martial arts. In fact, one of the largest martial arts tournaments in the world, the U.S. Open, has no minimum age requirement – rather an entire bracket for children under the age of five. This is said to be beneficial to professional child competitors, but what about the average student? While it is certainly possible to start training at this young age, we need to determine if it is in the best interest of not only the child, but also the parents and the instructors involved. Many children pushed into taking martial arts classes too early&nbsp;wind up burning out and losing motivation to continue. As a child, I remember a period of time when I only went to class to satisfy my parents who had already invested a good amount of money. Burnout causes many students to leave. To avoid burnout, open communication between&nbsp;the student, parents, and instructor is critical. Our <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/kids-martial-arts-classes/little-lions-preschool-martial-arts-lakeland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Little Lions pre-school kids class</a> is a perfect example of how this works.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7970" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103911/little-lions-self-defense-800x534.jpg" alt="little lions self defense" width="800" height="534" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103911/little-lions-self-defense-800x534.jpg 800w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103911/little-lions-self-defense-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103911/little-lions-self-defense-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103911/little-lions-self-defense-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103911/little-lions-self-defense.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h2>Focus</h2>
<p>One argument with what age is too young for martial arts involves the&nbsp;ability to focus. For example, two to three year olds may have the desire to learn. However, they often lack the focus and motivation to pay attention for more than a minute at a time. This may be counteracted by engaging the child in frequent play breaks or games. Retention is very slow at this age, but possible over a long period of time. A four to five year old child is much more likely to be able to engage in class, but&nbsp;will still have problems with retention. To help children remember what they have learned, games can be used. Kids (and for that matter, adults!)&nbsp;remember words better when put to a song. A child at this age may play games like &#8220;Sifu Says,&#8221; where the instructor will encourage learning by asking the child to perform moves that they had learned that day, while simultaneously making sure they can follow directions in a captivating manner.</p>
<h2>6-7 Year olds</h2>
<p>A six to seven year old may little bit better equipped to handle the demands of a martial arts class. Though the child will be slightly older and more able to comprehend, they are also likely to be more opinionated and resistant to training. This is, however, something that martial arts instructors are more than capable of dealing with. For the&nbsp;benefit of the child (and sanity of the parent),&nbsp;enrollment in a martial arts class is one of the best decisions a parent can make for their child. Our <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/kids-martial-arts-classes/kids-martial-arts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kids martial arts program</a> is second to none.</p>

<h2>All Children Can benefit</h2>
<p>All children can benefit from practicing the martial arts. The discipline, focus, and endurance gained will be an invaluable and impactful part of their childhood. The question is not necessarily how young is too young for martial arts, but rather what is the best age to start my child. At Sifu Och Wing Chun, we teach children as young as three years old. To deal with the attention issue our class is only 30 minutes and filled with fun. Learning a martial art is a lifelong journey—you&nbsp;might as well start early!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When teaching kids self defense classes in our Wing Chun <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/kids-martial-arts-classes/lakeland-after-school-martial-arts-program/">after school martial arts program</a>, a big part of that involves&nbsp;exercise. Exercising kids builds the muscles they need to use to be successful in self defense. Just as with <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/marketing/wing-chun-kung-fu-classes/">adult Wing Chun classes</a>, building muscles isn&#8217;t just for &#8220;the big guys&#8221;. Training kids is just as important for developing their self defense skill set.</p>
<h2>Reasons for Exercising Kids in Training</h2>
<p>After being at school all day long, we find that exercising our kids&nbsp;serves many purposes.&nbsp;Let&#8217;s examine just a few:</p>
<h3>Working Out That Energy</h3>
<p>The first thing exercising kids does is work out all that pent up energy from a day at school. While some schools continue to offer physical education, many do not. Of the ones that&nbsp;do, classes often involve&nbsp;low energy activities that don&#8217;t really allow them to expel energy. Kids need to move. They need to expel all that physical energy that accompanies their daily mental exercise. Without this exercise, kids tend to expend that energy in less productive ways.&nbsp;They can also work out their energy in scenarios where it&#8217;s not appropriate.</p>
<p>When exercising kids in our after school program, we give their bodies the means to get rid of energy built up during the day. It&#8217;s a release that helps their minds concentrate, and it prepares them for entering the next day&#8217;s activities.</p>
<h3>Building Muscles</h3>
<p>When we&#8217;re training kids, we try to build up their muscles. We&#8217;re not going for weightlifters, but rather well-rounded training. We want kids whose arms and legs have some &#8220;experience&#8221; with being used in activities likely to engage those same muscles during self defense. We want to exercise kids so that when we drill them in kung fu those muscles get&nbsp;trained.</p>
<h3>Preparing Them for More Rigorous Programs</h3>
<p>We train our kids hard because this isn&#8217;t the end. We don&#8217;t want them to stop with kids after school programs. They should be ready&nbsp;to graduate into our adult classes. When they do, their muscles will really be tried. They&#8217;ll be pushed&#8230;hard! With the way we have our kids exercising, these rigorous training methods won&#8217;t seem entirely unexpected when they arrive.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are probably even more reasons why we want our kids to train hard and exercise proficiently in our Wing Chun kung fu classes. The biggest reason, however, is that it&#8217;s fun. We actually like working them&nbsp;out, and we do so in ways that are fun and engaging. There&#8217;s no reason, at this age, that a good workout has to be boring. With a combination of fun games, and varied exercises, our kids Wing Chun self defense training builds muscles. It also builds confidence stamina, memory, and technique. We love it. They love it. What more could you want?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A family that trains together can all defend themselves. Is kung fu—the stuff of movies, childhood pretend games, and a popular karaoke song—something that can actually be a family event? Can Wing Chun kung fu be something a family does and&nbsp;learns together?&nbsp;Can it&nbsp;also actually be something they can protect themselves with? At Sifu Och Wing Chun, this is absolutely the case! Kung fu family training will not only equip every member of your family in self defense, it will also keep you healthy.</p>
<p>Kung Fu has two main components when focusing on oneself, internal and external. Both must be developed together to truly have growth within a given system. While the external focuses techniques dealing with striking or grappling, the internal focuses on the development of the person&#8217;s character. This development is something that all families would desire, not only for their children but for themselves. WIth a good kung fu school, families can exercise together, learn to protect one another, and grow closer by overcoming personal obstacles together.</p>
<h2>Kung Fu Family Training</h2>
<p>But can a family actually train so as to learn how to protect themselves? Is there a system that&#8217;s good enough to be&nbsp;used by adults and&nbsp;by children as well? The answer is yes! While there are many useful, powerful, and effective systems for self defense, it&#8217;s my&nbsp;opinion that&nbsp;none more effective across the board than Wing Chun. <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/instructors/sifu-justin-och-chief-wing-chun-instructor/">Sifu Justin Och</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;certified under four&nbsp;different lineages in the Wing Chun system.&nbsp;There is no more complete understanding of how this system can protect a family—in our area of the country—than at his downtown Lakeland&nbsp;studio in Florida. Since the Wing Chun&nbsp;system emphasizes&nbsp;directness, quickness, and speed, anyone—of any size—can overcome a larger stronger opponent. These attributes make the Wing Chun Kung Fu system one of the best systems for families to train together in.</p>
<p>Carl Douglas was right, &#8220;Everybody <em>was</em> Kung Fu Fighting&#8221;. And everyone should be. Kung Fu can bring people together through training, focus, and discipline. More, it has the&nbsp;goal of seeking peace with those around you. When you train in Wing Chun, you become part of a larger kung fu family—one that provides camaraderie, accountability, and lots of fun.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When most people think about Kung Fu, images of high flying wire fights from old movies comes to mind. For kids, you can add&nbsp;Jackie Chan&#8217;s crazy stunts and <em>Kung Fu Panda</em>. Most people don&#8217;t realize that being a Kung Fu master is so much more than fighting. In the modern translation it has been widely accepted to only refer to the fighting aspect of Chinese Arts. Kung Fu is actually translated as “acquired skill”. It&nbsp;involves anything that been achieved. So, should children participate in Kung Fu? Absolutely! In fact, kids kung fu training can help them assimilate a lot more at an earlier age than is possible when you&#8217;re an adult.&nbsp;Learning how to defend oneself and understand ones own body is very important. Becoming a person who conquers every&nbsp;goal&nbsp;he sets for himself is the true meaning of a Kung Fu Master.</p>
<h2>Serious Kids Kung Fu Training</h2>
<p>As children grow into adults they begin to learn patterns of behavior based on what is permitted by those in authority, friends, and mentors in their life. At Sifu Och Wing Chun the children are taught discipline as a first rule. Working synergisticly with discipline, is hard work and consistency. When those three are combined almost anything can be achieved. Sifu Och utilizes those aspects to teach martial arts in our <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/testimonials/lakeland-florida-afterschool-program/">Lakeland after school program</a>.&nbsp;Our hope is&nbsp;that those characteristics will bleed into the rest of the children&#8217;s lives. As they mature, they would have had a childhood of focus, a focus on goals that can only be achieved when one works to improve oneself to reach those goals.</p>
<p>If children are not given the chance to understand self development is ones <em>own</em> responsibility at a young age, how much harder will it be to not only understand that, but to be put into practice with the coming of age? Teaching&nbsp;kids kung fu&nbsp;gives us a chance to jump start that progress.</p>
<p>Imagine a generation that placed goals before themselves, and day in and day out sought to reach those goals. And while they themselves reached for their own goals, the also sought to uplift and encourage those around them to reach as well! Not only masters in the art of defense, but in art, music, food, and people! A generation that sought to improve the world around it with hard work, dedication, and a spirit of selflessness! While Kung Fu is not the answer to everything, it is most definitely a very powerful arena that one can sharpen and grow in.</p>
<h2>Effective Training Requires a Master</h2>
<p><a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/instructors/sifu-justin-och-chief-wing-chun-instructor/">Sifu Justin Och</a> has devoted his life to martial arts. As a person, he is one of the hardest working and focused men you will find. This work ethic, self motivated drive is manifested not only in how effective is Wing Chun is, but how he devotes himself to the betterment of his students. Working through exhaustion, overwhelming work requirements, he seeks to improve every single one of his students, inside of class, and out. He has developed his character to one of a Master, a black belt. When looking for someone to mentor your children these are aspects one should be looking for. Not just to see if they are good martial artists, but how do they treat those around them. And how well they perform at other tasks in their life.</p>
<p>Children must be led by example, and our kids kung fu training aims to do just that. If kids&nbsp;are surrounded by men and women that push themselves to a new level every day, they&#8217;ll learn those to be valuable traits. Our instructors&nbsp;care about each person that they come in contact with. Our hope is they will soon begin to follow suit. We want our kids&nbsp;to improve themselves every day—not just come to class and have fun, but grow, and develop. They will understand that with life, failure is a good thing—it is the ultimate teacher.&nbsp;We hope&nbsp;they can&nbsp;develop the habit of never quitting but learning. Martial arts gives them the opportunity to become uncomfortable, and then push past the feelings to seek a better version of themselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b></b>Learning martial arts, whether it&#8217;s Wing Chun or Jujitsu, offers a lot&nbsp;of advantages for students.&nbsp;While it&#8217;s possible to learn martial arts irrespective of age, the benefits of after school martial arts programs are numerous. children tend to learn and absorb techniques, combinations, and skills&nbsp;more swiftly and with greater ease.<span id="more-3336"></span>Our Sifu Och Wing Chun <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/kids-classes/lakeland-after-school-martial-arts-program/">after school martial arts</a> program provides classes in a variety of martial arts and offers innovative lesson plans. At a young age, kids&nbsp;are also very enthusiastic – our after school martial arts program in&nbsp;Lakeland receives so many applications from parents and eager children that we&#8217;ve had to expand several times. There is much that children can gain from learning a martial arts form. Here are just a few:</p>
<h2><b>Benefits of After School Martial Arts &amp; Self Defense<br />
</b></h2>
<p>One of the major benefits of after school martial arts has to do with the many reasons why martial arts have become popular of late. First and foremost is that they offer real-world self-defense techniques suitable to children. We live in a world that is&nbsp;increasingly dangerous, and mastering some form of self-defense activity can have many practical uses.&nbsp;Sifu Och Wing Chun&#8217;s&nbsp;martial arts program (both our adult and our children&#8217;s program) imparts simple yet effective lessons in self-defense that can prove to be handy for life. In terms of specific benefits, let&#8217;s go through just a handful here:</p>
<h3><b>Learning Lessons in Restraint<br />
</b></h3>
<p>But even as martial arts provide a means of defending oneself in trouble, it does not encourage violence and brutality.Fl Martial Arts Afterschool Lakeland provides classes in a variety of martial arts and offers innovative lesson plans. As their names suggests, all martial arts are essentially artistic. For instance, Wing Chun one of the most popular classes conducted in the Fl Martial Arts Afterschool Lakeland is distinguished by its swift yet graceful movements. Martial arts are not simply techniques of winning a fight, but are driven by a deep philosophy of achieving fulfillment and self-actualization.</p>
<h3><b>Valuing Education</b></h3>
<p>Most, if not all, martial art forms have been designed and developed in order to improve the body as well as the mind. In order to truly master any of these forms, one must ensure that they take in&nbsp;certain qualities in themselves&nbsp;&#8211; qualities like&nbsp;concentration, patience, and perseverance, as well as intense discipline.&nbsp;Our Sifu Och&nbsp;Lakeland after school martial arts program&nbsp;provides classes in a variety of martial arts and also offers innovative lesson plans. Even after years of practice, martial arts practitioners claim that they have much to learn and understand. The same&nbsp;values are imparted onto children during their school hours, but a co-curricular activity often proves to be a more effective way of teaching these&nbsp;values.&nbsp;In addition, learning martial&nbsp;arts and interacting closely with children who are also students of the form can improve their communication skills and boost their self-confidence.</p>
<h3><b></b><b>Better Health&nbsp;and Physical Fitness Practices</b></h3>
<p>Martial arts can also have many positive effects on the health of your children. There is no physical requirement for&nbsp;those looking&nbsp;to learn a martial art form&nbsp;&#8211; not even children.&nbsp;In fact, practicing martial&nbsp;arts is precisely what&#8217;s recommended for children suffering from health problems such as obesity or lethargy (it&#8217;s also great to build their work ethic!). Practicing martial arts regularly can help tone muscles, boost metabolism, get rid of excessive fat, and have a positive impact on immunity&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;keeping infections and diseases at bay.</p>
<h3><b>Learning Competitive Sportsmanship</b></h3>
<p>Students who master the nuances of their chosen martial arts form well can earn themselves a shot at participating in competitions and pursuing their interests more seriously.&nbsp;Our&nbsp;after school martial arts program&nbsp;provides lenty of options for advancement in the various forms and studies. A number of martial arts forms are being increasingly accepted as competitive sports, and some students may even consider taking up such arts professionally.</p>
<p>With our Sifu Och Wing Chun after school martial arts program&nbsp;in&nbsp;Lakeland, Florida, children can truly reap the benefits of learning a form of martial arts early in life&#8230;benefits that will last them their whole lives.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hand and eye coordination</li>
<li>Increase concentration power</li>
<li>Fast thinking</li>
<li>Quick usage of hand or foot</li>
<li>Concentration and power</li>
<li>Discharge of aggravation or energy</li>
<li>Cooperation</li>
<li>Ability to make friends</li>
<li>Self-control</li>
</ul>
<p>But Sifu Och&#8217;s Wing Chun Kung Fu can offer a number of specific benefits for children who face bullying. And, even if your child hasn&#8217;t faced bullying in school, it&#8217;s likely they will at some time in the future. Why not go into a situation prepared to do what&#8217;s right and what will provide the self defense they need to stay safe and master self-control?</p>
<h2>The Biggest Anti-Bullying Tool: Self Confidence</h2>
<p>Martial art also helps in bringing self confidence to&nbsp;your children. In fact a well-trained Wing Chun Kung Fu artist will typically develop a good sense of&nbsp;self confidence and self-control.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter whether a 10 year old is bullied by another kid of the same age or older. A fear response is dangerous and, in actuality, unreasonable. While&nbsp;this doesn&#8217;t mean&nbsp;that it&#8217;s not a&nbsp;powerful emotion, fear is irrational because it makes it even harder&nbsp;to respond appropriately. With fear, cascading emotions freeze up whenever the trigger is set off. Having training to respond properly alleviates this and results in a more self-confident child.</p>
<p>Wing Chun can really&nbsp;help individuals who are dealing&nbsp;with these&nbsp;feelings&nbsp;and issues of fear, and our training can help prepare them with practical solutions and steps to take to defend themselves from bullying using martial arts.&nbsp;We actually&nbsp;restructure your child&#8217;s confidence by giving them positive reactions to real-world situations, and then we support this with a combination of&nbsp;hard work, mind-engaging practice, and exercise. Our classes actually change the way your child walks and handles themselves in public, resulting in less bullying simple due to the presence of a more confident composure. When the language of the body is changed then the person also changes.</p>
<p>We actually address these topics and discuss them in&nbsp;the class, allowing the kids to take part in the conversation with regard to bullying. This lets&nbsp;the subject become less personal, while remaining perfectly applicable to them, making it more of a shared experience and lessening any&nbsp;feelings of pain from past experiences.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bullying is a big deal in school these days. Often, parents don&#8217;t know how to deal with it or how to really enable their children to get to a place where they&#8217;re not &#8220;victims&#8221; in their own schools and playgrounds.&nbsp;The truth is, parents can help prevent bullying with&nbsp;kids Wing Chun Kung Fu.</p>
<p>Bullying is actually a very great source of anxiety to parents in <em>addition</em> to the effect it has on a child. The terror bullying induces can cause&nbsp;reclusive behavior, result in&nbsp;poor self-image and self-body&nbsp;reflection, and kids can feel unloved and wanted. Unfortunately, most&nbsp;don&#8217;t even ask for help from their parents. We love to involve parents in the progress our kids make in Sifu Och&#8217;s Wing Chun kung fu classes. The smile on the faces of parents watching their kids excel is priceless.</p>
<p>It is a simple fact:&nbsp;kids <em>do</em> love working hard. Because of this,&nbsp;kids also love Wing Chun Kung Fu training since it also means they get plenty of hard work that results in visible progress. Don&#8217;t be&nbsp;surprised when the same enthusiasm demonstrated by these kids in the classroom leaks out into other environments where excellent behavior and&nbsp;discipline is called for.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying – A Great Concern to Parents</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, efforts to prevent bullying has become a 24/7 problem, and the anonymity of the Internet makes it more difficult to identify and punish bullies. But programs in which schools and the community work together to prevent bullying and reduce disruptive behavior can make a difference.</p>
<p>The benefits that a child gets out of<b> </b>Wing Chun Kung Fu are numerous and self-defense in only a tiny aspect of the same. Instead of making your kid a couch potato you can send them to a Wing Chun Kung Fu martial arts class as well as notice the following changes in them over time:<b></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Increase Social interactivity</li>
<li>They talk with Self Confidence</li>
<li>They are able to form opinions</li>
<li>Never fear to confess when they are wrong</li>
<li>Willingness to reveal their latest skills to the entire class</li>
<li>Better alertness with regard to health as well as fitness</li>
<li>Their concentration powers also increase</li>
<li>Hence they are confident to put these derived capabilities into their studies as well.</li>
<li>Unfortunately,&nbsp;Prevent Bullying has become a 24/7 problem, and the anonymity of <span class="cm_word" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #0000FF !important; text-decoration: underline !important; color: #0000ff !important;">the Internet</span> makes it more difficult to identify and punish bullies</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s only February, but the days are growing longer, and the temperatures are slowly starting to rise. Summer is right around the corner! Therefore, it is time to start thinking about who will be taking care of your children during the day while you’re away at work, and most likely there are several options for you to consider. You can leave them with a family member, hire a full-time babysitter, or enroll them in a day care center. Yet have you ever considered registering your Kids Summer Day Camp?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7265" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/24103343/lakeland-holiday-day-camps-florida-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu-300x171.jpg" alt="lakeland-holiday-day-camps-florida-sifu-och-wing-chun--kung-fu" width="300" height="171" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/24103343/lakeland-holiday-day-camps-florida-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu-300x171.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/24103343/lakeland-holiday-day-camps-florida-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu-400x228.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/24103343/lakeland-holiday-day-camps-florida-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu.jpg 580w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />When thinking about summer camp, individuals typically envision children experiencing the great outdoors, sleeping on bunk beds in a log cabin, hiking through the wilderness, roasting marshmallows over an open fire, and swimming or canoeing in a fish-filled lake. Although many summer camps of this variety do exist, they can cost thousands of dollars and your child can be hundreds of miles from home for weeks or even months.You can leave them with a family member, hire a full-time babysitter, or enroll them in a day care center. Yet have you ever considered registering your Kids Summer Day Camp.</p>
<p>Luckily, Lakeland Florida boasts several affordable day camps, each centered on different interests. For example, some focus solely on sports while others give children the opportunity to enhance their musical talents. On the other hand, some summer programs concentrate on academic enrichment, where campers engage in hands-on learning activities in math, science, etc. In addition, many Lakeland day camps are operated by trusted organizations such as area schools, universities, recreational facilities, museums, and churches.</p>
<p>However, the youth day camp hosted by Sifu Och Wing Chun in downtown Lakeland is one of the most unique summer programs in Polk County. Rather than practicing just one skill during the summer, children participating in Sifu Och’s summer camp are exposed to a variety of different activities led by certified staff members, including professional dance instructor Kevin Rios of Just Dance Academy of Dance and Ettiquette and Eastern U.S.A. International Black Belt Hall of Famer Sifu Justin Och.</p>
<p>Campers engage in professional dance, culinary arts, theater, arts and crafts, music, kung fu, taekwondo, Chinese ju-jitsu, karate, and boxing Monday through Friday from June to August. Therefore, children get the opportunity to broaden their horizons, to find out what activities they enjoy the most and will continue to pursue in the future. Furthermore,You can leave them with a family member, hire a full-time babysitter, or enroll them in a day care center. Yet have you ever considered registering your Kids Summer Day Camp. Sifu Och campers also participate in movie days and field trips to Barnett Family Park, Polk Museum of Art and other fun area locations. What a great alternative to sitting around the house this summer playing video games, watching cartoons, and eating unhealthy snack foods!</p>
<p>Although the children learn a little from all sorts of practices, the most important thing Sifu Och and his volunteers instill in their summer campers are basic life principles such as</p>
<p>discipline, teamwork, responsibility, respect, and restraint. In fact, before children can engage in martial arts and receive their Wing Chun Kung Fu uniforms, they must demonstrate the above characteristics. Additionally, Sifu Och and his staff require children to clean up after themselves, help others in need, and control their behavior. If certain campers are unable to act with discipline, their privilege to participate in activities is revoked.

<dt>$125 week for Summer camp *this is an internet special (normal cost $180/week), those who lock in this early bird special will have it locked per week for the ENTIRE summer without worry of rising weekly cost.&nbsp; This price does not include additional activities such as Busch Garden&#8217;s, Bowling, Movies, etc.&nbsp; Though because of the size of our program we get BIG group discounts on trips which normally can not be done by smaller programs.&nbsp; (teacher to student ration is appox. 10-15 students per teacher on staff)&nbsp; Which means you get the one on one of a small program with the benefits of a making a bunch of friends.&nbsp; Space is limited.</dt>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Sifu Och Afterschool Programs, Building Character</h2>
<p>Instead of sitting around the house lazily watching cartoons or playing video games, children ages 4+ are expanding their talents and developing character at the Wing Chun Sifu Och Afterschool Programs in downtown Lakeland. Each weekday, children are exposed to a different skill—but only after they’ve finished their homework and received help from certified staff tutors.</p>

<p>Mondays are dedicated to culinary arts, and this school year, students have learned about different spices and their uses, kitchen safety, the functions of certain cookware, and how to read a recipe. One of the children’s favorite culinary lessons so far was concocting their own no-bake cookies by following a detailed recipe.</p>
<p>On Tuesdays, students practice several dance routines led by professional dance instructor Kevin Rios of Lakeland’s Just Dance Academy of Dance and Etiquette, an after school programs partner. Children are currently performing hip-hop line dances such as the Kung Fu Electric Slide (a combination of the popular 70s anthem “Kung Fu Fighting” with the movements from the “Electric Slide” line dance) and “The Wobble.” When the children are finished moving to the high energy beats, Sifu Och takes control of the class and teaches several martial arts techniques from the kung fu, Chinese ju-jitsu, karate, taekwondo, and boxing styles to build flexibility, agility, and strength.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2005" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2005" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/24101704/IMG_02041.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-2005 size-medium" title="sifu och lakeland florida martial art after school program" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/24101704/IMG_02041-300x200.jpg" alt="sifu och afterschool program lakeland florida martial art" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/24101704/IMG_02041-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/24101704/IMG_02041-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/24101704/IMG_02041-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/24101704/IMG_02041-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/24101704/IMG_02041.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2005" class="wp-caption-text">after school martial arts lakeland, fl</figcaption></figure>
<p>Martial arts instruction is also the main focus of Thursday’s program, while Wednesdays are solely dedicated to dance. Finally, Friday’s lessons rotate between arts-and-crafts and theater. Children are currently enjoying an improvisation unit, but they will soon be preparing for a unique, full-scale performance based on the Christmas story.</p>
<p>Although the children learn a little from all sorts of practices, the most important thing Sifu Och and his volunteers have instilled in the students are basic life principles such as discipline, teamwork, responsibility, respect, and restraint. In fact, before children can engage in martial arts and receive their Wing Chun Kung Fu uniforms, they must demonstrate the above characteristics.</p>
<p>“You have to teach them the basics before they can make it in martial arts—and life,” said after school program volunteer and Wing Chun student Liz DeVries.</p>
<p>Sifu Och After School Program staff members require much out of their students, requiring them to clean up after themselves, help others in need, and control their behavior. If certain students are unable to act with discipline, their privilege to participate in activities is revoked. Minor infractions, on the other hand, result extra exercises like the despised sprawls, also known as squat thrusts or burpees.</p>
<p>Sifu Och also challenges his students to demonstrate character at home and in school. For example, if a student successfully performs 40 chores in 2 weeks, he/she will receive a yellow uniform belt stripe. In addition, if a student scores an “A” on three quizzes or tests or obtains a report card with all A’s and B’s, he/she will earn a blue stripe. Other stripes—green, black, and red—are collected by mastering martial arts techniques with power and displaying leadership qualities.</p>
<p>This is the first year Sifu Och Wing Chun has partnered with Just Dance for this unique sifu och afterschool programs. So far, it has been a huge success as approximately 42 children from seven different area schools attend each day, and the program is still accepting new students.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you are interested in seeing your child grow, achieve, and discover new passions, enroll him/her in the Sifu Och After School Program today for just $75/week. Register online or call (863) 800-0171</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We like to call it &#8220;bully proof martial arts&#8221;—bully self defense skills that help your kids avoid or overcome bullying in school.&nbsp;We all want our children bully-proof and able to respond correctly after all the talking, negotiating, and attempts fail to stop bullies from&nbsp;starting an altercation. When your child is bullied it can be psychologically destructive to their confidence, thought, concentration, and even how they conduct themselves in the future. A&nbsp;bully and bullying can consume a&nbsp;child&#8217;s every thought, from nighttime dreams&nbsp;to dreading the realities of the next school day.</p>
<h2>Bully Self Defense Skills Aren&#8217;t Passive</h2>
<p>Your child can try to ignore a&nbsp;bully, but this usually causes a bully to get more aggressive or confrontational. Bullies like to make sure their victim knows they are still in control&nbsp;and the threat is real. Bully proofing your child with Sifu Och Wing Chun gives him or her&nbsp;increased confidence, self preservation skills, and self-assurance. Techniques to protect and keep your child safe during&nbsp;a physical confrontation is just one aspect of what we do, but we&nbsp;excel in the&nbsp;instruction needed to get results and keep your kids safe. In our <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/kids-classes/kids-martial-arts/">kids martial arts program</a> your child will learn more then most martial arts schools are ever willing to teach—and it&#8217;s all safe, fun, and disciplined.</p>

<p><strong>A testimonial from one of the parents at our Lakeland, FL after school program:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>We needed to make a switch. Our 11 year old was bullied last year at school to the point of needing counseling. His whole demeanor changed, and his grades went from A&#8217;s and B&#8217;s to C&#8217;s and D&#8217;s. At one point we weren&#8217;t sure if he was going to advance to the next&nbsp;grade—all because of bullies. Eventually, we found Sifu Och Wing Chun and their kids martial arts program (which teaches bully self defense skills). After training here, our son is himself again, and he has his confidence back!&nbsp;Both our boys now&nbsp;attend the Wing Chun Lakeland&nbsp;Florida&nbsp;<a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/kids-classes/lakeland-after-school-martial-arts-program/">after school martial arts program</a>.&nbsp;I don&#8217;t think I could be happier with the program.</p>
<p>Wing Chun is teaching our boys to be respectful and responsible. Sifu Och is a great role model. They are learning to think before they act and that with every action comes a&nbsp;reaction. I am very happy my husband and I found this program in Downtown&nbsp;Lakeland, and it&#8217;s so close to home. I would most definitely recommend the Wing Chun martial arts afterschool program to anyone looking for a great quality, safe, and affordable place for their children! &#8211; Debra H.</p></blockquote>

<h2><strong>Anti-Bullying Tips for Parents</strong></h2>
<p>Bullying is a real, constant threat. With today&#8217;s mass media, bullying no longer occurs in a just a limited&nbsp;local. With&nbsp;text and social media, bullying can be a 24/7 scenario. It&#8217;s critical to listen to, and be aware of, what your children are&nbsp;exposed to. Their emotional suffering can last long after a bullying incident. Never say “just ignore it”. Your child is talking to you for a reason—listen. Be persistent until school administration or another parent takes action on your child’s situation.</p>
<p>Name calling, common in bullying, can lead to raised tensions and anger. Tell your child not to hit when called names or when verbally attacked. Bully self defense skills are only for stopping physical confrontations.</p>
<p>A child should also never raise their fists unless it&#8217;s to protect themselves from bullying and forms of physical abuse. Teach them other ways to diffuse a situation, and let them know physical action is the<em> last</em> line of defense.</p>
<blockquote><p>Just a few weeks ago&nbsp;I noticed the signs. As a Wing Chun martial arts instructor in the Sifu Och school, I know the signs of&nbsp;a child being bullied. I pulled both the brother and the sister aside to ask them if everything was ok. At first they looked at each other and said, &#8220;Yes,&nbsp;everything will be&nbsp;OK.&#8221; I&nbsp;asked <em>what</em> will be OK,&nbsp;only to find out&nbsp;that the sister had been slapped in the face on the&nbsp;bus and&nbsp;verbally assaulted. The brother had witnessed this, and though he was a top member of the wrestling team with a military father, he didn&#8217;t know what to do. I then found out he had been&nbsp;bullied in school as well and though&nbsp;he&nbsp;seemed confident around others he told me&nbsp;that at school he just tries to avoid being in the halls, and he&nbsp;has begun hating certain classes that he previously loved. When asked why they hadn&#8217;t told their mother (who is a wonderful&nbsp;woman), they said they were afraid they would get punished or blamed. Children, no matter how many times you talk to them and tell them to come to you, are not well-trained to do so. It sometimes takes an outside instructor or&nbsp;teacher who&#8217;s looking out for you and your family to help in these matters.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Anti-Bullying tips for Kids</h2>
<p>Remember NOBODY has the right to make you feel bad or hurt you! Bullying includes, but is not limited to: Physical actions (pushing, kicking, punching), name calling, threatening texts or social media messages, rumors, or any means to upset and harm you—do something!</p>
<p>It is NOT your fault if you are being bullied. Tell a trusted adult or friend about the incident. Together, you can solve the issue or direct it to someone who can. If the first person you talk to can’t help you, keep asking until you find someone who will help you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you can write down everything that has happened.</p>
<h3>Things NOT to&nbsp;do!</h3>
<p>Don’t hide your feelings or what is happening from a trusted friend or adult. Secrecy is a bully&#8217;s biggest weapon, which is why they go through so much effort to keep you from telling someone.</p>
<p>Don’t try and deal with a bully on your own. There is no fault in asking for help. With more people on your side, the bully can be brought to justice.</p>
<p>Always tell the truth. When you exaggerate and lie, you become untrustworthy, and it becomes harder to believe you.</p>

<p>Tips Anti-Bully self defense and being bullied in school</p>
<blockquote><p>“Why do they tease me, call me names? Is something wrong with me? I don’t want to feel this bad.” These are the thoughts from bullying. Hurtful and cruel words directed to make the victim feel helpless and weak. Bullying targets all ages, sexes, and races. It is therefore necessary that children learn techniques for addressing and preventing bullying.</p></blockquote>
<figure id="attachment_1919" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1919" style="width: 199px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/24101645/IMG_0889.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1919" title="no more school bullying tips sifu och wing chun martial arts anti-bully self defense" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/24101645/IMG_0889.jpg" alt="no more school bullying tips sifu och wing chun martial arts anti-bully self defense" width="199" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/24101645/IMG_0889.jpg 311w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/24101645/IMG_0889-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1919" class="wp-caption-text">stop school bullying &#8211; tips for parents<br />sifu och wing chun anti-bully self defense</figcaption></figure>
<p>More incidents of bullying are occurring away from adult supervision. On the playground, outside school, or even on school busses where an adult is present but occupied. When parents or adults cannot be counted on children need to learn how to approach these dangerous situations. Learning how to talk down situations and keep cool under pressure are always the first means when approaching a bully. Simple talks can undo misunderstandings and prevent fights.</p>
<p>Sadly not all matters of bullying can be resolved by talking things over. When fighting becomes involved bullying turns into intense violence. Wing Chun teaches children how to defend if caught in a situation where they must protect themselves or a friend. Blocking and attacking simultaneously with controlled movements can render an attacker defenseless or immobile until help arrives.</p>
<p>It is the respect taught for oneself and others that has one of the most important benefits. Through bowing or waiting the next command children learn discipline and concentration. Progress is measured by striped on a belt which reinforce goal settings.Each accomplishment reinforces children with confidence and a self-awareness of who they are and what they stand for. Knowledge that they do not deserved to be bullied, life lessons that will direct them when faced with any adversity.</p>
<p>Bullying doesn’t end there. Parents and kids need to be aware, and more, proactive! Learning how to protect oneself from being a victim of bullying can be a determining factor of how well children score in school and develop socially and emotionally. Sharing information through social media,online publication, newspapers, magazines, local print, or just talking with someone is a great way to reach out to others.</p>
<p><strong>Reminder &#8211;</strong> Wing Chun Kung Fu does not promote or encourage the use of violence against others! Wing Chun Kung Fu is a martial art founded on high morals and strong principals of protection, fitness and focus. It is through friendship, respect and self-discipline that Wing Chun advances, not through unnecessary violence.</p>

<h2>lakeland fl afterschool kids</h2>
<p>A stripe on a belt or a higher grade in the classroom are part of the same goal setting process. Setting goals help children plan for the future and “think smart”. Long term planning skills are developed and children widen their understanding how things work in a big picture.</p>
<p>Goal setting skills allow children to choose what they want to achieve and how to go about doing it. Children start asking important questions of “How do I balance my work and play time to do what I want to do?”, “Will my actions help or hurt me for getting what I want?” and “I need help to reach my target. Who can ask for from knowing making kids leaders they will assist me in a positive way?”.</p>
<p>More concentration and effort is put into their actions. This is the early formation of organization skills. &nbsp; &nbsp;The size of the goal is not important it is the act of executing one. Setting goals is a life skill. The demands of life only increase and making kids leaders a strong intrinsic motivation will help ones confidence continue to grow. Even if they do not realize the gains they’re making its a great habit to instill early on.</p>
<p>Everyone is making kids leaders likely to face some stumbling blocks along the way. It can be demoralizing not to accomplish a goal. An environment of comfort and support is created through our students and parental involvement. Children realize they never have to face problems alone and can always lean on someone they trust for help.</p>
<p>Working in a group to accomplish our personal goals, building confidence and making kids leaders&nbsp;life long friends is all achievable through the Wing Chun system!</p>
