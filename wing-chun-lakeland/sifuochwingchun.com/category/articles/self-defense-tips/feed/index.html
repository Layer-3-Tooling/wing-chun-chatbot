										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wing Chun is not the easiest martial art to teach. The techniques come from a philosophy and list of principles. Due to this, the application of the techniques can be done with many variations that can be considered &#8220;correct&#8221;. These variations can cause added frustration. This is due to the details when it comes to teaching the variations. So that being said, you need to give ample attention to your students to genuinely help them understand, learn, and apply their Wing Chun. Sifu Och&#8217;s three sections of teaching his main classes help accomplish that.</p>
<h2>Sifu Och&#8217;s Three Sections of Teaching</h2>
<h3>Beginner Class</h3>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-9136 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/24104747/women-wing-chun-kung-fu-class-training-high-block-biu-sau-punch-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-florida-usa-300x200.jpg" alt="women wing chun, kung fu, women wing chun class, high block, biu sau, punch, wing chun kung fu, lakeland, florida, usa, women wing chun kung fu" width="300" height="200">The beginner class is for those students that are within their first year of training. We typically have one main instructor on the floor who has trained for at least 3 years. He or she helps the new student&#8217;s build their fundamentals. The focus of this section of class is to build their immediate ability to stop basic, common attacks. In our article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/when-to-teach-wooden-dummy-chi-sao/">When to Learn Chi Sao &amp; Wooden Dummy</a> we cover in more detail what our philosophy is for that class. We want to make sure that when a student leaves our doors the are able to hand dangerous situations as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Much like a building we must set the groundwork. Within someones first year of training we teach them the basics to a few things. First, we guide them through the basics of footwork. Second, while building their footwork we help them through the concepts of using two hands at the same time. Thirdly, we want to build an attacking mindset. Instead of being focused on the perfect counter, block, or defense, we want our students to build an immediate offensive mindset.</p>
<h3>Intermediate Class</h3>
<p><a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/sifu-ochs-three-sections-teaching/wing-chun-coach-training/" rel="attachment wp-att-9230"><img decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-9230 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-scaled.jpg" alt="Coach Level Training, Wing Chun Combos, Wing Chun Timing" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-800x533.jpg 800w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-1400x933.jpg 1400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24104820/Wing-Chun-Coach-Training-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>For our Intermediate class we move past our basic footwork and attacks and start building our combinations. After initial contact you must follow up to finish your opponent. Building on the foundation of attacks we begin to teach students how to effectively and efficiently follow up.</p>
<p>Not only do we build in the ability to follow up and finish an opponent we also begin to lean heavier into reaction training and sparring. There are three main stages of development which I go into more detail in my article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/the-3-training-cycles-of-martial-arts-tips-for-the-beginner/">Three Cycles of Martial Art Training</a>. The last of these stages is reaction which is the hardest to master. Speed, technique, power, all mean nothing if you do not have the correct timing.</p>
<p>Conner McGregor said &#8220;Precision beats power, and timing beats speed&#8221; in a post fight interview. You can take this one step further and say that without any form of timing you cannot fight. So you MUST develop your timing. Wing Chun is very effective when used properly. But due to many attacks being intercepts versus blocks, learning the timing can be tricky. You must devote consistent hard work in sparring and active attacker training.</p>
<h3>Advanced Class</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7095 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/24103144/Long-Pole-Weapon-Fighting-or-Dragon-Pole-300x200.jpg" alt="Wing Chun Long Pole, Weapons, Wing Chun Instructor" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/24103144/Long-Pole-Weapon-Fighting-or-Dragon-Pole-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/24103144/Long-Pole-Weapon-Fighting-or-Dragon-Pole-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/24103144/Long-Pole-Weapon-Fighting-or-Dragon-Pole-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/24103144/Long-Pole-Weapon-Fighting-or-Dragon-Pole-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/24103144/Long-Pole-Weapon-Fighting-or-Dragon-Pole.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>At our advance class level we begin the refinement of the techniques. We being teaching and using the Wooden Dummy at this level. Now that there has been years of using the Wing Chun shapes and applying them against pressure we can now upgrade them to the fullest level.</p>
<p>The Wooden Dummy training helps conditioning of the arms as well as tightening of form. Since the dummy does not hit back it serves no purpose other than that refinement of techniques. Spacing, shapes, rooting, all can be worked on using the dummy.</p>
<p>When at the advanced class we now also pass on the more traditional aspects of Wing Chun including Long Pole and Butterfly Swords. Wing Chun needs to stay applicable to the current martial arts you might run in to. However, you must keep your roots strong in the history of your training. Now that your training is coming full circle we finish the circle with advanced techniques and weapons.</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/when-to-teach-wooden-dummy-chi-sao/">When to Learn Wooden Dummy &#038; Chi Sau</a> appeared first on <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com">Sifu Och Wing Chun</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learning martial arts is much like a knife. You will take your training through stages before you can use it. The two main stages involved are crafting the knife and sharpening the knife. When to Learn Wooden Dummy &amp; Chi Sau depends on your view point in regards to these stages. I will speak from the perspective that I was taught at Sifu Och Wing Chun. That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that it is the &#8220;correct&#8221; way, it is simply how we do it here.</p>
<h2>Knowing when to teach Wooden Dummy &amp; Chi Sau</h2>
<p>Stage 1 &#8211; The view point that is at Sifu Och Wing Chun is one based in immediate application. When a student walks into our door we want to teach them street applicable techniques as soon as possible. We have had multiple students come into our studio living in dangerous situations. Our first advice is always to get away from the situation or people causing the problems. But when it comes to the techniques we can&#8217;t teach them Chi Sau or Wooden Dummy because at that moment it is not applicable.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2561" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2561" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-2561 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/24102023/IMG_5447-300x200.jpg" alt="women's self defense in lakeland florida women self defense sifu justin och wing chun kung fu martial arts" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/24102023/IMG_5447-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/24102023/IMG_5447-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/24102023/IMG_5447-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/24102023/IMG_5447-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/24102023/IMG_5447.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2561" class="wp-caption-text">women&#8217;s self defense in lakeland florida women self defense sifu justin och wing chun kung fu martial arts</figcaption></figure>
<p>They must be able to deal with dangerous situations and attacks immediately. We want to equip them with a basic defense against hooks, hard straight punches, take-downs, pushes, grabs etc. Once they have an established based we want to add onto their skill by adding combinations, transitions, and working against and with weapons. Finally, free sparring to train you on how to use and deal with other martial arts combat reactions.</p>
<h2>The Need for Chi Sau</h2>
<p>Now, the argument might be made that without Chi Sau it will be difficult to enhance certain aspects of your reflexes. To this I agree to a point. In Chi Sau you deal with close quarter sensitivity reaction as well as redirection and close range trapping. So it is a vital aspect of training Wing Chun.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-4181 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24102505/lakeland-fl-self-defense-lakeland-fl1-300x182-300x182.jpg" alt="wing chun classes" width="300" height="182">However, for the new student, Chi Sau may be difficult to use as a tool. You must train Chi Sau to learn structure before using it for reaction. Making sure that you have constant forward energy, balanced strength, and good relaxation can takes weeks to months of hard training.To fill in the gab between sparring and Chi Sau we use wrist against. This is essentially Chi Sau reaction hands without the rolling.</p>
<p>The same is essentially true with the wooden dummy. But instead of referring to reaction the wooden dummy would deal with structure and positioning refinement.</p>
<p>Stage 2</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7055 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/24103123/grandmaster-ip-chun-eldest-son-of-ip-man-sifu-justin-och-hong-kong-china-300x216.jpg" alt="grandmaster ip chun, Ip Chun, eldest son of ip man, ip man, sifu justin och, hong kong china" width="300" height="216">Stage 2 can be equated to the sharpening of the knife. You now have a good solid foundation in your techniques. You know how to apply them and it what situation they should be used. Now we must work to make them stronger, easier, more efficient. This is the perfect place for Chi Sau and Wooden Dummy. With the correct context in mind when applying the techniques, the refinement of them now has a purpose.</p>
<h3>The Knife</h3>
<p>Reverting back to the knife analogy. Imagine having a slab of metal and sharpening one side of it. Now, what do you have? A slab of metal with a sharp end. There is no way to use it as desired. Building the knife takes time. The handle, the guard if wanted, the length. You must make this part of the knife first before you can sharpen it. If you do not you are not only going to have a much hard time sharpening it but you will have an unusable knife.</p>
<p>Now, this goes without saying, all of the above depends on your goals. If you are seeking to learn Wing Chun to find balance in your life. Develop your mind and find new friends, then learning these aspects of Wing Chun sooner than later makes sense. However, if you are looking for the combat of Wing Chun then saving that for later is suggested for When to Learn Wooden Dummy &amp; Chi Sau.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Intercepting is always better than blocking. We are going to look at what the definition of intercepting is before we give some practical ways of accomplishing that. Webster&#8217;s dictionary defines intercepting as &#8220;to stop, seize, or&nbsp;<a class="mw_t_a_link" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/interrupt">interrupt</a>&nbsp;in progress or course or before arrival&#8221;. The best way to view intercepting is that last part of the definition, &#8220;interrupt&#8221;. Not only is the attack itself being interrupted, but the timing of your opponent should be as well. And that is the key, the timing. When timed properly your opponents attack will be nullified and you will be primed to launch a second attack (in theory before his second) or you would have already hit him. Now that we have addressed what intercepting as a concept let me provide you with&nbsp;4 Ways to Intercept your opponents attacks using Wing Chun.</p>
<h2>4 Ways to Intercept</h2>
<h3>Intercepting Fist</h3>
<figure id="attachment_9018" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9018" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-9018 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104722/25625458_10214390795338812_1361328337_o-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104722/25625458_10214390795338812_1361328337_o-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104722/25625458_10214390795338812_1361328337_o-768x576.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104722/25625458_10214390795338812_1361328337_o-400x300.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104722/25625458_10214390795338812_1361328337_o-600x450.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104722/25625458_10214390795338812_1361328337_o.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9018" class="wp-caption-text">Intercepting Fist</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em;">The first technique we will go over is the Intercepting Fist. Made famous by Bruce Lee, this technique is typically taught fairly early on in student&#8217;s training. The idea is to counter the opponents punch with a punch of your own. By keeping your elbow down and pressing from center mass you are elbow to offset your opponents strike. This can quickly be follow up a flurry of punches we refer to as Chain Punches. Keeping the strikes down the center you are able to maintain control of your centerline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em;">When you substitute a Paak Sao with an intercept you will find it can be much easier to deal with a second and third punch. Part of this is due to the fact that you are returning the opponents punch with a punch. They will be slightly less confident with their next punch as opposed to when you simple deflect their initial punch with a Paak. Second to that, the Intercept automatically covers your opposite side incase of a second attack. Whereas the Paak leaves you more open.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>Turning Punch</h3>

<p>The Turning Punch basically the other side of the same coin referring to the Intercepting punch. The Intercepting fist is typically used to refer to the lead hand being used with the lead foot to interrupt the opponent. This is illustrated in the first photo above.</p>
<p>Turning punch is simply using the the same structure but opposite hand to accomplish the same goal. Since the punch is coming from the back foot, the turning punch will have more power and torque then the straight Intercepting. However, much like the Paak punch, if not used properly, can leave you open on the inside for an attack.</p>

<h3>Tan Sao</h3>
<figure id="attachment_8459" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8459" style="width: 201px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-8459 " style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104212/17917075_10212076512923198_254854088_o-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="268" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104212/17917075_10212076512923198_254854088_o-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104212/17917075_10212076512923198_254854088_o-400x533.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104212/17917075_10212076512923198_254854088_o-768x1025.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104212/17917075_10212076512923198_254854088_o-450x600.jpg 450w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104212/17917075_10212076512923198_254854088_o.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8459" class="wp-caption-text">Tan Sao</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Tan Sao is a very effective and sound way to intercept a strike. You have not only nullified the attack but you have also almost guaranteed a strike of your own. Tan and the actual punch are the exact same shape. The only exception is what the hand is doing at the end. You can see here in the photo the Tan Sao is an hand open towards the ceiling. By opening the hand the focus of the technique is diverted to the elbow. The Punch itself can be delivered to the head, or for a taller opponent you can strike the ribs.</p>
<p>Since the Tan extending through the strike towards your opponent, it makes stopping a second strike fairly straight forward. You can transition to a Paak Punch if the Strike is down the center. Or, you can continue pressing forward with a Bui Sao against a hook punch.</p>
<h3>Paak Punch</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_8427" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8427" style="width: 197px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-8427" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104146/17901892_10212042861041922_1811866813_o-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="197" height="262" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104146/17901892_10212042861041922_1811866813_o-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104146/17901892_10212042861041922_1811866813_o-400x533.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104146/17901892_10212042861041922_1811866813_o-768x1025.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104146/17901892_10212042861041922_1811866813_o-450x600.jpg 450w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104146/17901892_10212042861041922_1811866813_o.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 197px) 100vw, 197px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8427" class="wp-caption-text">Paak Punch, Kick</figcaption></figure>
<p>Our last technique for this article on intercepting attacks is the Paak Punch. Clearing the attackers hit with Paak good, but combining it with straight punch is better. Since the Paak is coming off of the back foot there is a lot of power and structure with this counter. The Paak is also quite diverse.</p>
<p>When used, you can use the Paak to press forward and crush the attackers structure. You can guide his hand downward if he is taller. You can also use it to setup a baiting for the second punch.</p>
<p>Bonus: The Paak Punch is also a great attack to throw in a kick along with it. By doing this you maximize Wing Chun&#8217;s ability to use multiple weapons at once. You can see here in the photo, Sifu Justin used the Paak, Punch, and Kick. He uses the kick just before the punch clears the arm to finish the attack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>When it comes to Intercepting timing is everything. You can have GREAT structure, technique, and power. But, if you do not practicing your techniques in LIVE sparring scenarios you will get hit no matter how good you think you are. There is no substitute for hard work, and good punches to the face. Train hard and never give up.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Afterschool Kung Fu Fun is an overview article about how to enjoy teaching your afterschool kids martial arts class. Take a look!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to teaching children anything it can be either a complete drag, or the most fun you will have the whole day. Your attitude will determine whether or not the clock will slowly inch it&#8217;s way to the next minute or run out before you realize class is done. I will explain here in Afterschool Kung Fu Fun the three &#8216;E&#8217;s&nbsp; to actually enjoy teaching a kids class no matter the age.</p>
<h2>Afterschool Kung Fu Fun</h2>
<h3>Establish Discipline</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7990 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/24103920/Lakeland-preschool-little-kids-martial-arts-kickboxing-karate-kung-fu-dad-and-me-300x216.jpg" alt="Lakeland little lions kids preschool martial arts kickboxing karate kung fu ages 3 - 5 years old" width="300" height="216">The first thing that must be done is to establish a line of discipline with the student&#8217;s. Without discipline there will be utter chaos in the class. No matter how fun the class is there will always be some sort of disruption. In my article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/afterschool-martial-arts-showing-you-care/">Afterschool Martial Arts: Showing You Care</a> I explain in details a few details about establishing discipline. Understanding the line between fear and respect is crucial. Contrary to belief you cannot force someone to respect you. You can make them act a certain which may be perceived as respect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Respect is only achieved when the student&#8217;s know that you truly care about them. &#8220;People don&#8217;t care how much you know, until they know how much you care.&#8221; This is a phrase I live by. Before class starts I try to speak to as many of them as possible. I can build individual relationships with them and they can connect with me. We build trust and respect this way.</p>
<h3>Embrace Your Inner Kid</h3>
<p>Once you have established your discipline your class will go much smoother than without. A focused energy rises in the class when discipline is held across the room. You must capitalize on this energy. To use it you must embrace your inner child. If your 12 year old self were to be in this class what would make it fun? Answer that question over and over and you will find you are making new and exciting ways to do drills. You will find yourself looking forward to class. It becomes a chance to really have fun with your class.</p>
<p>By &#8220;becoming a kid&#8221; again you&#8217;ll see that you have the ability to take the same workouts and put a new spin one them that the kids will love. A perfect example is around Christmas time. At Sifu Och Wing Chun we have the kids to military crawl for part of the warm. The spin I tell them is that they are the Grinch and they have to sneak through the house without getting caught. Another fun warm up spin is something I call &#8220;ninja mode&#8221;. The students pretend to be ninjas while I give them instructions. Whether it is running quietly or jumping to avoid the incoming &#8220;sword&#8221;. They are able to get a good workout hidden under the guise of pretend.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7211 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/24103305/lakeland-kids-martial-arts-classes-afterschool-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu-300x216.jpg" alt="lakeland kids martial arts, martial arts, kids, martial art kids, kids classes, kids martial arts, lakeland, florida, fl" width="300" height="216"></p>
<h3>Explain Quickly</h3>
<p>The last thing that must be done is crucial. You must learn to be efficient with your explanations. Since their young minds have trouble focusing you must be potent with your talks. Clear and concise are your best friends. If you are able to explain techniques quickly you can spend more time drilling, working on their focus and persistence. Long explanations can also wear them out. While you don&#8217;t want to skimp on good info you have to find the balance or their little legs won&#8217;t be able to handle standing still for too long.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>To wrap things up. Three keys to having a good kids class: Establish discipline, Embrace your inner kid, and Explain quickly. If you can put all of these things together you will really enjoy teaching your kids class no matter the age.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The Strength of My Wing Chun is the Story of Ryan Beck and his training at Tampa Wing Chun. Read to see how he has grown and will never stop Wing Chun.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en"><u><b>The Strength of My Wing Chun: By Ryan Beck<br />
</b></u></span></span></span></h1>
<p>Wing Chun is different for each practitioner: how they move, when they flow and even the strength used. Each person is trained and trains differently; they all have different weaknesses and advantages. There are skills we all must learn and others that must be figured out individually. These gains can come fast while others take years to achieve. After approximately three years, I have seen these gains made by myself and others.</p>
<h2>My Wing Chun Start</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8965 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104639/Ryan-Beck-300x166.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="166" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104639/Ryan-Beck-300x166.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104639/Ryan-Beck-768x424.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104639/Ryan-Beck-400x221.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104639/Ryan-Beck-600x332.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104639/Ryan-Beck.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />When I first started training with Sihing Garret in Tampa, I was the only regular student. His boxing background, plus his time training in Wing Chun really set his skills apart. After the first class, I told myself, that no matter what, I would commit to training for at least one year, at that point I would re-evaluate. Not even two months later, I came to the realization that Wing Chun was in my soul and I was hooked.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en">With any form of martial arts, there are typically two types of gains: physical and mental. Physical goals are the easiest to see. I noticed I was moving faster, able to go longer, and could even tell my eyes where processing information faster. Slowly, was becoming a better fighter. I believe this primarily has to do with my instruction, training and dedication. These physical gains are generally noticed fairly consistently by all. You get out what you put in. These are the gains that pushed me through my first year.</span></span></span></p>
<h2>Wing Chun Year Two</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en">When my one-year marker hit, I looked back on all the gains I had made. The surprising part about this reflection was the mental and lifestyle achievements. These types of gains are much harder to identify. I saw my temper cooled, I was eating healthy and living a healthy lifestyle. The craziest part was that these changes, these gains started to become evident, when I saw the people around me changing as well. They were growing through my growth. My wife and our two daughters started eating healthier, drinking water and working out. In addition, my wife and our girls are on their own martial arts adventure too.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8964 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104637/Ryan-Beck-2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104637/Ryan-Beck-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104637/Ryan-Beck-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104637/Ryan-Beck-2-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104637/Ryan-Beck-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/24104637/Ryan-Beck-2.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The only limitation Wing Chun has to personal growth, is people’s willingness to grow. It’s not always easy to train. Let’s be honest, it’s hard work. After a long and hot day at my job, I don’t always want to train. We can always find a reason. I will never forget my Sifu once said, “instead of an excuse, just say it’s not a priority.” This is something I strive to apply to all aspects of my life. The interesting part is that once I am at class, I am always glad that I went. This is true in life, it’s never as bad as we thought it was going to be.</span></span></span></p>
<h2>Wing Chun For Life</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en">Over the course of my Wing Chun journey thus far, I have found three strong reasons why I will never quit Wing Chun. The first reason is my family, I see the change in them and they look to me for guidance in life. Without martial arts, I am not sure I would know what direction to take them. The second reason is the tradition and culture, I have always been interested in the history and where Wing Chun comes from &#8211; not only the fighting, but the lifestyle as well.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en"> There is such a history, that every time I Chi Sao, I feel like I am a part of something bigger than myself. The third and final reason I will never quit Wing Chun is the personal and physical aspect. I have grown tremendously since starting Wing Chun. The best part is how much growing I still have left to do. I know I can be faster, I know I can be even more technical and I know I have a lot more to learn and for me this is exciting!</span></span></span></p>
<h2>Your Wing Chun Journey</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en">Gains can always be made in Wing Chun as long as goals are being set and matched, as long as a person is dedicated to train and as long as the community is strong. Wing Chun is limitless! If I can train hard even when I don’t want to or kick open new doors when I am too tired to, then there is nothing I can’t do, in life or in Wing Chun.</span></span></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this Article: &#8220;A Letter To Myself-Marcus Morales&#8221;, Marcus tells us his story of how he started his Wing Chun Training. We hope you enjoy this little story!</p>
<h2>A Letter To Myself-Marcus Morales</h2>
<p>Do you know the feeling you get when you are about to do something and you do not know what the outcome is going to be? It happens all the time. For example, imagine it is the middle of summer, you are at the local pool cooling off along with a bunch of other people, and suddenly you decide you want to dive off the platform and continue to develop your patented cannonball dive. There you go, walking past everyone and you climb to the first level.</p>
<p>But, You realize that there are steps that will take you to the second tier and you follow them up another level.Then you see there is yet another set up steps and they take you to the very top platform. Somehow, you have managed to get up there, where no one else dares to go. There you are, standing at the highest level at the public pool with your lucky red bathing trunks. The ones with yellow rubber duckies on them. You look down and see that you are on the edge, staring at the crystalline blue water, deciding whether or not to jump.</p>
<h3>The Jump</h3>
<p>That is exactly how I felt when I was standing outside the door of Sifu Justin Och&#8217;s Martial Arts school. I was standing there, watching everyone doing all kinds of crazy things. Trying to decide whether to step inside or just keep walking. I must confess that I only knew a little about Wing Chun. I consider myself to be a bit of a tough guy; grew up in some tough neighbor hoods. I also served my country for six years and finished my obligation with an honorable discharge. During that time I even came back from a major injury in the Army. Suffice it to say, I thought I was tough enough. But something kept urging me to step inside, so I did.</p>
<h3>In the Water</h3>

I stood there, at that ceramic tile square at the entrance to the school. And the, Sifu came along and welcomed me in. He was not what I expected. Truth is&#8230;I didn&#8217;t know what to expect. But he walked up to me, with a thousand-watt smile on his face, and made me feel right at home. I didn&#8217;t know this until later, but he had just finished wrestling on the floor with some of his students.</p>
<p>One more thing I did not expect. I was still a little defensive, mostly because I didn&#8217;t know much about how things worked. All Sifu did was invite me to join in on the class he was conducting and then he would get back to me to see whether I wanted to be a part of it, so I accepted the invitation. I have not left the school since.</p>
<h3>Learning How to Swim</h3>
<p>From the very First minute you become a part of the school&#8217;s family and its culture. I was automatically being grabbed and tossed. I even received a stiff punch to the face, and just like that I was absolutely drawn to the scene. Somehow, despite all the punches and tosses, the sore bones and sprains, I have become more and more involved in the art. Sifu is there, with a smile on his face, teaching you everything you need to know about the art. And this is not a man who is boastful or driven by a sense of superiority. No&#8230; this man truly loves to tach, he wholeheartedly love the art, and he absolutely enjoys his students.</p>
<h3>Sifu Och</h3>
<p>One other thing that Sifu Och strives for at his school is the development of a community within the school. He is constantly coming up with events for the school, activities designed to strengthen the camaraderie within the student, to help foster positive relationships between the students, ones that they can potentially carry along wit them throughout their lives. I have come to believe that his desire to develop and nurture these positive relationships is at the core of the most successful martial arts school. Creating bonds not only between student and teacher, but between students, strengthens the school itself.</p>

<h3>Sifu&#8217;s Students</h3>
<p>The students at the school are without a doubt the greatest assets Sifu has at his disposal. From the Green Sashes all the way to his instructor level students. They understand Sifu&#8217;s philosophy when it comes to helping everyone who start training. They</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Comparing martial arts has been happening for ages. It has it&#8217;s benefits but if not done with respect it has it&#8217;s pitfalls. Before I get into my article I want to clarify this article is a technical analysis of the two styles. It is not designed to bash either still but to show how one style would deal with the other. Wing Chun Vs. Tae Kwon Do is a hot topic because of how wide spread Tae Kwon Do is and the rising popularity of Wing Chun. &nbsp;This article will hopefully give some insight into the two styles if someone is looking to train in one of them.</p>
<h2>My Wing Chun Vs. Tae Kwon Do</h2>
<p>Having started in Tae Kwon Do and now studying Wing Chun I use both in my training. Wing Chun is used as my primary art which I train against other ex Tae Kwon Do practitioners. I then return the favor as the “bad guy” helping my Wing Chun family against my Tae Kwon Do. Needless to say I have much experience using the two arts against each other. I will first address using my Wing Chun against Tae Kwon Do.</p>
<p>Wing Chun seeks to destroy the enemy as quickly as possible. Using structure and an overwhelming wave of attacks the aim to not give your opponent a chance. But to be maximized it must close the distance and keep it closed. Trapping can be utilized, which to someone who doesn&#8217;t grapple or know any counters, can be detrimental. The issue can be found in closing that distance. One of the most useful tools I employ is making sure I attack with at least two weapons.</p>
<h3>Entry</h3>
<p>Kicking while either blocking or intercepting an attack is a favorite. With my the Wing Chun structure keeping both hands and at least one foot in range allows me to hit multiple points at once. This disrupts most peoples timing. This also serves to slow down my opponent if he is very mobile. A stomping kick (or what we refer to as a Shadow Kick) to the thigh usually does the trick.</p>
<h3>Understanding the Opponent</h3>
<p>A Tae Kwon Do fighter will try to use his reach and distance. Switching kicks quickly can be tricky to deal with. However, if directness is maintained it won&#8217;t be a problem. Front kicks can be dealt with by using a Bui Ma step with a Gan Punch to clear the kick. A back up option is simply dropping the lead elbow on the ankle of the opponent. Round houses are usually stopped using a Double Jum Sao followed up with a back fist or chop. Because of the structure of Wing Chun once the distance is closed the opponent usually doesn&#8217;t have much of a response.</p>

<h2>My Tae Kwon Do Vs. Wing Chun</h2>
<p>When fighting another Wing Chun student the hardest part, as mentioned above, is the directness.<br />
I must keep my distance and rely on speed, fakes, and mis-directions to even come close to landing a good strike. Using my lead foot I will fake low and go for a head shot. This is one of the most effective strikes if I time it properly. Second to that a spinning back kick can be slipped under the protecting hands of a Wing Chun Fighter if executed quickly enough.</p>

<p>The hardest part again, is keep the Wing Chun fighter away. Quick movement in and out, outside hook heel kicks, and low to high kicks are the best options.</p>
<h2>Which One</h2>
<p>Of the two systems I do prefer Wing Chun for combat.. Even though the Tae Kwon Do fighter might be more mobile, the Wing Chun system provides a more sound answer to attacks. Based on my experience Wing Chun allows me to end a fight much more quickly which to me is the most important part.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a reason the title is &#8220;Your Black Belt Journey&#8221;, it&#8217;s YOUR journey. No one else can walk your life. You were created for a purpose and it&#8217;s your job to walk it to the best of your ability. That being said, too many times we see students comparing themselves to another student. In this article I will discuss what it means to walk the journey on the road to a black belt.</p>
<h2>Your Black Belt Journey</h2>
<p>Anything worth having takes time to get. Earning your Masters degree in Engineering, finishing Ranger school, a successful life long marriage. All of these things have something in common, they took a long time and a lot of hard work to achieve and/or maintain. People tend to treat martial arts different. As if learning to defend yourself from a threat is easier then one of these skills. Defending your family while fighting off multiple attackers or maybe even just one is not something you can learn in a weekend seminar. Yet, people continue to say they&#8217;ll &#8220;give it a try&#8221;. Or they will &#8220;do some Wing Chun&#8221; as if it were finger painting session with their friends.</p>
<h3>Building a lifestyle</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7472 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/24103605/contact-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-florida-300x110.jpg" alt="contact sifu och wing chun, kung fu, lakeland, florida, sifu och wing chun, contact us, kung fu lakeland, wing chun lakeland" width="300" height="110" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/24103605/contact-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-florida-300x110.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/24103605/contact-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-florida-768x280.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/24103605/contact-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-florida-400x146.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/24103605/contact-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-florida-600x219.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/24103605/contact-sifu-och-wing-chun-kung-fu-lakeland-florida.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />To really learn self defense you must embrace it as a lifestyle. The same thing that is said about being healthy is true here. If you &#8220;go on a diet&#8221; you will eventually go back to your un-healthy ways. You must change how you live as a whole. You must become a healthy person. They choices you make a the grocery store, restaurants, and gym time. This is who you are and what you do. Not an activity you participate in for a few weeks. The same is exactly true in training self defense.</p>
<h3>But I&#8217;m High enough ranked I&#8217;ll be ok</h3>
<p>In my previous article 3 cycles of martial arts I explain that there are 3 main stages to training: Programming, Application, Reaction. <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-6745 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/24102759/lakeland-fl-sifu-och-florida-wing-chun-schools1-191x300.jpg" alt="Advanced Wing Chun classes sparring training" width="191" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/24102759/lakeland-fl-sifu-och-florida-wing-chun-schools1-191x300.jpg 191w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/24102759/lakeland-fl-sifu-och-florida-wing-chun-schools1.jpg 217w" sizes="(max-width: 191px) 100vw, 191px" />All 3 take time to develop in reference to a technique. But the most important thing is they must be maintained. If you do not keep up your training then you will NOT BE ABLE to respond to a threatening situation. Reacting to an attack takes split second reflexes as well as a situational awareness that maximizes your time. You may remember techniques from your training time but applying them quick enough will be very hard to accomplish.</p>
<p>The proof of this is many previous higher ranking students will come back from a hiatus and will struggle greatly with sparing and gor sao and lower ranking current students. That being said, setting goals and reaching them is a huge help when it comes to training as you go. But you should not have a rank as an end game. Living your life like a Black Sash is the key.</p>
<h2>You Must Change</h2>
<p>The Sash itself is NOT the goal in martial arts. It is the person you become while trying to obtain it. When you envision a person who is a &#8220;Black Sash&#8221; you typically picture someone who is wise, patient, hard working, compassionate. You must become the person you envision as a Black Sash. That transformation into something new only happens under the heavy anvil of rigorous, consistent training. Be reaching for small goals (i.e. your next rank) you have something you can slowly move towards and develop those characteristics on the way.</p>
<p>Nobody else can walk this path for you. You must accept where you are as a human. Recognize the type of person you must become. If you were a Black Sash how hard would you train? How compassionate would you be towards others? How loving would you be towards your family? These characteristics are what make a Black Sash. What are you doing to become that?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have just begun your training in martial arts you know it can become very frustrating. You can feel lost in the material. Confused on a technique. Or you feel like you are behind where you should be. All of the these factors make starting martial arts difficult for the newbie. In this article, 3 Training Cycles of Martial Arts, we will explain a concept that will hopefully help you push past the first slump.</p>
<h2>The 3 Training Cycles of Martial Arts</h2>
<p>There are 3 basic stages of learning a new technique. Once you understand these stages you will be able to identify where you are and what you need to work on. What you must understand is everyone develops different. Some learn the initial technique faster than others. Yet those same students may struggle in applying it. Everyone learns different. You must accept where you are so you can focus on YOUR development. Don&#8217;t stress about the progress of others. That being said, lets look at these 3 stages.</p>
<h3>Stage 1: Programming</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7794 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/24103714/learn-self-defense-now-300x200.jpg" alt="learn self defense now" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/24103714/learn-self-defense-now-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/24103714/learn-self-defense-now-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/24103714/learn-self-defense-now-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/24103714/learn-self-defense-now-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/24103714/learn-self-defense-now.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The first stage of training begins with programing. This is exactly like installing a new system into a computer. It takes time. When a new technique is shown it comes with a new set of motor functions the body is not used to. To overcome this the body needs time to &#8220;program&#8221; the new function into the &#8220;hard-drive&#8221;. Some students are more prone to certain techniques. Maybe they grew up doing a certain sport that had a similar movement to what they are learning now.</p>
<p>For instance, in Wing Chun there is a lot of rooting through the heels. If someone spent a lot of time lifting growing up they might be able to grasp that concept a little quicker. As opposed to someone who played soccer for instance. They would have been taught to always be in their toes. Therefore, they would need to spend more time teaching their body to draw power from the heels then the first person.</p>
<h3>Stage 2: Application</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7856 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103757/Developing-the-Student-Mindset-300x200.jpg" alt="Developing the Student Mindset" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103757/Developing-the-Student-Mindset-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103757/Developing-the-Student-Mindset-768x512.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103757/Developing-the-Student-Mindset-400x267.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103757/Developing-the-Student-Mindset-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24103757/Developing-the-Student-Mindset.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Secondly, after you have learned what the new technique is and how to perform it you must learn WHEN to perform it. This is called application. One technique can have many applications and then variations from that original. Applying the technique must also be treated like the programing because you are learning how to time it against an attack. You must be attacked over and over again to get the timing down.</p>
<p>Along with timing the technique another very important part of application is learned and testing: structure. Without structure a block or attack will be ineffective no mater the timing. Just like gold is refined in fire so must the structure of a technique be refined through the fire of pressure. Pressure testing your structure helps develop your shapes that shadow training (or practicing in the air) can never do. Real attacks must be thrown and you to really develop your structure. Combining the timing and pressure training will give you the ability to fully apply your techniques.</p>
<h3>Stage3: Reaction</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8764 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104425/20273304_10213122446550885_1533157015_o-1-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104425/20273304_10213122446550885_1533157015_o-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104425/20273304_10213122446550885_1533157015_o-1-400x533.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104425/20273304_10213122446550885_1533157015_o-1-768x1025.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104425/20273304_10213122446550885_1533157015_o-1-450x600.jpg 450w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24104425/20273304_10213122446550885_1533157015_o-1.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />Thirdly, the final stage of developing your technique is reaction. You have could structure and timing, but how will your fair when you do not know when the attack is coming? Reaction is the hardest part of training. You must build one technique at time. Learn how to react to one certain attack. Once you have dealt with that you build again from step one. Program a new technique; apply it to real attacks; react to it in a sparring scenario. You must learn how to deal with skilled and un-skilled attacks. Single attackers and multiple attackers. As well as Feinting, counter striking, grappling, High-low hit combos. All of these things and more must be thrown at you.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this cycle must be repeated over and over again. Day by day, technique by technique, this must be done. Consequently, if you stay consistent with your training you will master every technique given to you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The Kickers Guide A-H (Part I): Once you learn how to use your legs, a whole new world of possibilities opens up. And it is a beautiful world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Kicking is hands down one of my favorite things to do. It’s just so versatile. Once you learn how to use your legs, a whole new world of possibilities opens up. And it is a beautiful world. But this world is full of complexities and a ridiculous amount of different kicks. Not to mention the fact that almost every martial art will perform each kick slightly differently. These two facts combine to make learning kicks more difficult than it needs to be, but we are here to help clear some of that confusion. The Kickers Guide A-H (Part I) is a nearly comprehensive list of kicks known to the martial arts world:</span></p>
<h1>The Kickers Guide A-H (Part I)</h1>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Axe Kick</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">An axe kick is usually preformed either to someone already on the ground or to the collarbone/sternum of a standing opponent. Use a straight leg to come in a downward motion striking with the heel. The two biggest variances are in the load of the kick: some people perform axe kicks by swinging a straight leg up into the air and back down again, while others bring their knee to their chest, kick up, and then drive down. The first is easier to perform and more common. The second offers a more controlled technique and is better for attacking a standing opponent.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Back Kick </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Also known as a donkey kick, this kick attacks an opponent that is directly behind you. This kick is more commonly used in fights where there are multiple opponents, as for a general rule you would not want to turn your back on an opponent. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Butterfly Kick</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">This kick is often more for demonstration than practical self defense. It comes from either standing, or a running step in. The body twists as both legs come off the ground, one after the other, with the entire body more or less parallel to the ground. Striking occurs with the heel coming down on the opponent. A very beautiful kick.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Fish Kick </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">A flick like kick done with pointed toes, typically aimed at the groin. The kick comes up in a snapping motion, with the strike occurring somewhat like the flick of a fish’s tail. This kick also targets the head during fighting combinations that end with the opponent being pulled down to knee height.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Front Kick (Push/Snap)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">A front kick refers to either an upward snapping motion (striking under the chin), or a forward thrusting motion (pushing with the ball of the foot). Either way, the kick comes in a direct line in front of the body, usually with the hips squared. This kick is often used to push opponents away, or as an entry move to a follow up technique.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Half-Moon/Crescent (Reverse Half-Moon/Crescent)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">This kick starts with the knee brought up and into the chest. The foot is then thrust out and around, from the outside of the body in. The reverse kick comes from the inside out. This kick is primarily used as an entry move to get past an opponent’s guard, but can also strike to the side of the face or body.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-8427 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104146/17901892_10212042861041922_1811866813_o-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104146/17901892_10212042861041922_1811866813_o-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104146/17901892_10212042861041922_1811866813_o-400x533.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104146/17901892_10212042861041922_1811866813_o-768x1025.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104146/17901892_10212042861041922_1811866813_o-450x600.jpg 450w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104146/17901892_10212042861041922_1811866813_o.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Half Crescent/Tong Kick</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">A forward thrusting kick done with the foot and knee tilted at a 45° angle to the outside of the centerline. Directed toward the knees, hip, or ribs. The Tong kick is similar to the Half Crescent Kick, except the foot and knee are tilted at a 45° angle to the inside of the centerline. This can be aimed at the diaphragm or chin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">These kicks and more make up the bottom half of our martial art strikes, keep an eye out for our next article on the second half of these kicks!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ability to close the distance with an opponent is essential to any Wing Chun practitioner. You must be able to quickly respond to an opponents attack and shut them down to avoid follow up attacks. Different ranges call for different responses. That being said we will cover a few Wing Chun Entry Techniques here in this article. Before reading this article we suggesting checking out our previous article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/wing-chun-vs-jab-cross-hook-takedown/">Wing Chun Vs Jab, Cross, Hook Takedown Combo. </a>We explain the difference between committed and non-committed strikes which is essential to your training.</p>
<h2>Hand Entries</h2>
<h3>Paak Slip</h3>
<p>In our previous article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/wing-chun-vs-jab-cross-hook-takedown/">Wing Chun Vs Jab, Cross, Hook Takedown Combo</a> we touch on the idea of using the Paak to simply slip off the first punch. Connected is a video of Master Sifu demonstrating this technique. He explains how to utilize the Paak to deflect the initial blow and then glide off into a strike. A very effective and quick technique.</p>
<h3>Paak Punch</h3>
<p>The Paak Punch is a very effective combo to use. Instead of trading blow for blow with an opponent, the Paak Punch allows you to strike and defend at the same time. When countering a cross or straight punch this is a definite must. You are able to either crush a punch and counter above it with a punch of your own. Or, you can slip the punch and strike the ribs. Either way you are able to immediately counter straight punches and close the distance.</p>
<h3>Paak into Bui or Tan</h3>
<p>If an opponent does not throw a committed strike it can be very difficult to throw a counter. In this case it would be prudent to defect the first punch with a Paak and then counter the second punch. Two great choices would be either a Tan Punch or Bui Sao Punch.</p>
<p>A Tan Punch would be a great choice against any sort of straight punch. Since the Paak would have simply deflected the first punch you can use this as a set up for the second punch counter.</p>
<p>If he throws a haymaker or wide hook the Bui Sao Punch would be the best choice. The curved shape of the Bui Sao would match the trajectory of the hook allowing for maximum protection.</p>
<h2>Kick Entries</h2>
<h3>Shadow Kick</h3>
<p>If facing an opponent that moves a lot, pushing off the front foot, a Shadow Kick may be a option to consider. Our article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/kung-fu-kicks/">Kung Fu Kicks</a> goes into more detail about this kick. The idea is to crush into your opponents leg with a stomping motion. Typically aimed to blow out the knee the lead hand will typically drop as a result opening up an nice window for an attack.</p>
<h3>Crescent Kick</h3>
<p>Finally, the Crescent Kick. One of the most effective ways to use this kick is to the ribs when they extend their punch. This has the same shape as the Shadow Kick but instead of going down it strikes forward. You must thrust your entire body behind the kick. When this is done the head usually comes down as a result of the body caving into the kick. This allows for an easy strike to the head.</p>
<h2>The Key to Closing the Gab</h2>
<p>All of these techniques are futile if you do not close the distance with the right timing. You can only develop timing with hours of practice. Doing techniques in lines are a great way to build the structure for them and speed. However, if you do not consistently keep up your training your timing will be off an no amount of skill will help you if you do not time it correctly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Sparring is an essential part of most martial arts. But when it comes to gear, each school decides how much and of what type to wear. While some schools require the use of sparring gear in all combat situations, others are a lot more lenient. They might only require it for designated matches and competitions and in some cases, not at all. Some people argue that sparring gear doesn’t actually keep us safer, but can even increase our chances of getting hurt. Others don’t want to wear it because it can be bulky and cumbersome. So where do we draw the line?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>Why wear gear?</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">If competition is your goal, then the answer is because they require it. The North American Sport Karate Association (NASKA) rules require head gear, hand and footpads, mouthpiece, and groin cups for all adult competitors. For competitors under seventeen, they also require chest and face guards. If you are training to be a professional competitor, or are at least serious about competing, your training should always include the gear that you will wear on competition day. If you practice with less gear, or none at all, competition day will feel awkward and slow. In fact, many competitors practice with weighted gear so that when they go back to wearing regular gear they feel lighter and are able to hit faster. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">If your goal is to simply stay safe while training, you may need to take a different approach. Depending on what martial art you practice, different gear may be more beneficial than others. For instance, some martial arts frequently incorporate the use of elbows and knees. In these arts you may want to consider adding elbow and knee pads, especially if they are actually making contact. Other arts that heavily rely on kicks to the body may need a chest guard. Or if your art includes more eye and facial strikes, a face guard might be in order. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>Could wearing head gear actually hurt?</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">There is an argument going around that head gear increases your risk of brain trauma over not wearing gear at all. This argument comes from personal opinion though it does rely on facts. Perpetuators of this idea claim that the added inch or two of padding make your head a bigger target, and more likely to get hit. It may also lure fighters into believing that they won’t get hurt, making them less defensive of their head. They also claim that head gear impedes your peripheral vision, further increasing your odds of getting hit. While they have not yet tested this phenomenon, they have tested how effective head gear is at reducing the impact to your brain. Wearing head gear can reduce the trauma to your brain by about 50% (McIntosh &amp; Patton, 2015). While 50% is eons better than zero, it is still a relatively low number. Thankfully this statistic is pushing manufacturers to invest research into creating a more effective head gear. Something that we will hopefully see in the near future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">So what gear will you wear? Personally, as someone who sustained a concussion while not wearing head gear, the choice is easy. I would wear anything with the potential to reduce brain trauma, no matter how annoying or obtrusive it may be. Protecting your brain is not something that should be taken lightly. But for others without the same experience, maybe going without seems like the better option. Whatever choice you make, make sure to make it from the point of sound research and not momentary comfort. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">It should come as no surprise that cardio and weightlifting can both greatly improve your abilities as a martial artist. People have been using cardio and weightlifting to supplement their martial arts for as long as martial arts itself. The health benefits they provide are beneficial to every aspect of life, but what do they do specifically for the martial artist?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>Cardiovascular Exercise</b></span></h2>
<h3>Treadmill vs Sparring</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Doing any martial art will include a good amount of cardiovascular exercise. In fact, one study showed that performing martial art kata’s and engaging in sparring increased heart rate to a higher level than that of running on a treadmill (Iide et al., 2008). This is mostly due to the fact that kata’s and sparring engage the upper body in more dynamic movements than running does. That’s not to say that running on a treadmill doesn’t add its own benefits to martial arts, because it does. The cardio performed while practicing martial arts is usually in short bursts, ranging from less than a minute to about three minutes on average. And while this (quasi-interval training) has its own benefits, the endurance gained from long distance running takes martial artists to the next level. It allows them to excel during prolonged testing periods and back-to-back sparring matches.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7154" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/24103213/lakeland-kickboxing-classes-fitness-men-sifu-och-wing-chun.jpg" alt="lakeland boxing, boxing lakeland, kickboxing lakeland, lakeland kick boxing, kick boxing lakeland, fl, florida, kickboxing, kick boxing, classes, fitness" width="300" height="216"></p>
<h3>Recovery</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Martial arts instructors are particularly known for pushing student’s bodies to the limit in class. They want not only for you to build muscle, but also to have the ability to keep pushing even when your body wants to quit. Cardiovascular exercise after a workout can help remove some of the toxins built up in your bloodstream during that workout. Effectively reducing the muscle soreness sure to come in the days to follow (Clark, 2015). And for no other reason, if you do need to use your training in a real street scenario you have no idea hard long you will need to engage your enemy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>Weightlifting </b></span></h2>
<h3>Adding Power</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">There have been countless studies done on the benefits of weightlifting, however, very few in regards to martial arts. One such study found that weightlifting has the ability to “increase punching and kicking speed, or power” (Iide et al., 2008). This same study suggests adding in twisting crunches to increase torque power behind the hip rotations so common in martial arts. Has an instructor ever told you to put more hip behind your strike? In addition, incorporating cleans and snatches could help in generating more explosive leg power for kicks and structure. </span></p>
<h3>Strength Down to the Bone</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">But weightlifting goes beyond additional speed and power, affecting our bodies down to bone. Other studies show that lifting can improve bone density. “Not only can weigh training increase bone density, it can improve muscle mass, balance and connective tissue strength” (Seltzer, 2013). With all of these factors combined, the risk of injury in martial arts is greatly reduced. Think about all the times that you have been hit or thrown to the ground. Improved balance and connective tissue strength could make the difference between a fall and a serious injury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Adding cardio and weightlifting will provide numerous benefits not only to your martial arts training, but also to your overall health. And if you are looking to combine cardio, weightlifting, and martial arts, consider making our kickboxing classes a part of your training regimen. Sifu Och personally explains some of our training in his article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/muscle-conditioning-kung-fu/">&#8220;Muscle Conditioning With Kung Fu&#8221;</a>.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sparring has many faces across the martial arts and is even used for different purposes. But you would be hard pressed to find a martial art that doesn’t include it in some form. That form can be one of many things: (standing, ground, light contact, point, continuous, ect.). Even so, we will focus on entry sparring moves from a traditional standing match. Entry sparring moves include all techniques that make the opponent more open or vulnerable to follow up techniques. These almost always preformed in a sequence of moves instead of a single strike. The following are some of the most used as well as some personal favorites from our kwoon.</p>
<h2>Entry Sparring Moves</h2>
<h3><b>Jab and Cross</b></h3>
<p>The jab and cross combo is one of the most basic and widely used sparring techniques. It is simple and effective against an untrained opponent. And even some of the more thoroughly trained ones. The jab cross is simply two consecutive punches, aimed toward either the same or different locations. One is off of the front leg and the second off the back with a little more added torque. The idea is that the jab cross happens so fast that the opponent has a difficult time blocking both the first and second attacks. Ideally if the first punch doesn’t make it, the second one will.</p>
<h3><b>Low Kick, High Strike</b></h3>
<p>Another great entry move involves performing a low kick, and following it up with a strike to the head or upper body. The low kick will often cause the opponent to drop their hands in order to protect their lower body, opening them up for a higher strike. Even if the opponent doesn’t wind up dropping their hands, they are often at least slightly distracted by the kick – allowing for your follow-ups to have a better chance.</p>
<h3><b>Fakes</b></h3>
<p>Faking attacks has the potential to distract, like a low kick or jab, only without as much risk of failure. Oftentimes people will go to block “fake” attacks that never would have hit them. This allows for the attacker to predict where the opponent’s hands will be after the fake in order to best follow up. Usually the fake will cause the opponents hands to drop or move away from their body, something that can be predicted and exploited if done correctly.</p>
<h3><b>Huen Sao &amp; Faak Sao</b></h3>
<p>The Huen Sao and Faak Sao are specific to Wing Chun, although other arts may have their own versions of the moves. A huen sao is the circling of a hand with the intention to move around an opponent’s arm, much like a snake would slither around a tree branch. Once you use this move to get around the arm, the opponent is open for rib and upper body strikes. The Faak Sao uses a forward chopping motion in which the arm and hand are horizontal. It is typically used to either intercept a high attack or to attack an opponent’s head. When used to intercept a punch, it can clear the way for a second attack.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8589" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24104330/growth-in-wing-chun-lakeland-florida-sifu-och.jpg" alt="Growth in Wing Chun Kung Fu lakeland Fl" width="300" height="216"></p>
<h2>Just one more</h2>
<p>A lot of times in sparring you have to assume that the first attack you throw is not going to make target; that is essentially the reason that combos exist. But even though we assume it may not hit, that doesn’t mean that we treat it like it won’t. And because these are some of the more common sparring moves, make sure that you aren’t falling for them. Or better yet, make yourself learn equally great counter moves to all of these entry attacks. Even just adding any one of the above techniques to your repertoire of sparring moves would make a great asset. But why stop at one?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Wing Chun vs Jab, Cross, Hook, Takedown</h1>
<p>Wing Chun vs Jab, Cross, Hook, Takedown was a question a beginner posted for anyone to answer on a Facebook group. He asked for the key to using&nbsp;Wing Chun vs Jab, Cross, Hook, Takedown Combo. Sifu Justin Och and Senior Instructor Garret Brumfield posted a video titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bfI2MOn_oI">&#8220;Wing Chun vs Jab, Cross, Hook, Takedown Combo&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7bfI2MOn_oI" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>In this article we will address some of the finer points. Stopping&nbsp;this combo is no easy task but Wing Chun does have an answer.</p>
<h2>Wing Chun vs Jab, Cross, Hook, Takedown Combo</h2>
<h3>The Jab</h3>
<p>If you are to deal with an attack you must understand it. To understand strikes you must make a distinction between committed and non-committed strikes. A committed strike could be defined as a strike that has the entire weight of the body fueling the power for the strike. Alternatively, a non-committed strike will be much faster but won&#8217;t have the power. A jab is a non committed strike. That being the case, the counter must be equally fast. As you can see in the video Sifu Och uses his paak sao but immediately follows up with a straight punch. This allows for quick adjustments where needed.</p>
<h3>The Jab, Cross</h3>
<p>If your opponent crosses immediately after his jab you may not have time to follow up off the initial strike. Sifu chose is one of the most direct options to counter although there are many variations. The hand that was used to paak the initial strike simply follows its trajectory to the face. In conjunction, the back hand paaks the next strike. This results in and immediate strike to your opponents face.</p>
<h3>The Jab, Cross, Hook</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s say that your counter does not damage your opponent enough. As a result, he follows up again with a hook. The hook that Sifu Och Demonstrates is a very tight &#8220;rabbit&#8221; hook. Theses types of hooks are very hard to deal with. A Bui Sao, Bui Jee, Man Sao will be very hard to execute in this scenario. You must be able to fully extend these techniques for them to become effective. When the opponent throws this hook, it will be very tight to the body with a lot of torque. Torque equals power, and if you are unable to fully extend your technique it will crumble. In this scenario Sifu chooses to utilize upward elbow to cover the opponents strike. He is now able to strike with is other hand and move on with his attack.</p>
<h3>The Jab, Cross, Hook, Takedown</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-8389 size-medium" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104117/17693117_10211973694912812_345342688_o-225x300.jpg" alt="wing chun vs jab cross hook" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104117/17693117_10211973694912812_345342688_o-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104117/17693117_10211973694912812_345342688_o-400x533.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104117/17693117_10211973694912812_345342688_o-768x1025.jpg 768w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104117/17693117_10211973694912812_345342688_o-450x600.jpg 450w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104117/17693117_10211973694912812_345342688_o.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></p>
<p>Finally, we moved on to dealing last part of the&nbsp;combo. None of your counters have successfully stopped your opponent but because you are in so tight he feels the need to shoot in and take you down.&nbsp;There are two scenarios to be address when an opponent shoots in on you. If he gets under your elbow or not.</p>
<p>If he does not get under your able a you can simple remove the foot he is attacking and stop his forward motion with a Gum or Jum Sao to the neck\head.&nbsp;This is addressed in our article <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/fighting-footwork/">Fighting Footwork</a>&nbsp;where we go into a little more depth. However, if he does get behind one of your elbows you must sprawl back or you will be taken down. Once you have sprawled you can then establish a line of defense again with your Jum or Gum Sao. This line allows you to regain your structure and move on with your attack.</p>
<h2>End the fight</h2>
<p>At each stage of the attack your goal as a Wing Chun practitioner should be to the end the fight. When you respond to an attack you should be immediately seeking to follow it up to finish your opponent.&nbsp;You would only utilized these counter techniques if you are unable to flow into and 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc. follow up. So in theory, your opponent will never get to his takedown, or his cross for that matter. However, that is why we as martial artists should always be prepared. If the worst happens, you will be ready.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can have the fastest hands in the world, but if you aren&#8217;t at the right place at the right time that won&#8217;t matter. Foot work is literally the foundation to any style. You may be able to block or evade an attack here and there with good hands or head movement. However, if you do not base your counter with fighting footwork, it will be difficult to execute.</p>
<h2>positioning your Fighting footwork</h2>
<p>Superior angles will make your life much easier. It is much simpler to deal with an opponent when you have minimized their ability to use multiple &#8220;weapons&#8221; at once. In the same way, striking your opponents key points will also be easier when you are positioned correctly. Wing Chun seeks to dominate the outside angle allowing maximum trapping and striking to occur.</p>
<h2>Weight distribution</h2>
<p>There is a big debate among Wing Chun practitioners. Not only about weight distribution through the feet but also between the legs. First let&#8217;s address weight through the feet.</p>
<h3>Heels</h3>
<p>When a weight lifter squats his weight must drive from the middle portion of his foot to his heels. With proper skeletal alignment his structure is locked in place and only the strongest muscles are recruited to move the weight. If alignment is broken serious injury can occur. When finished correctly the weight will be completely on the heels as seen here. <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8359" src="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104112/squat-form.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="347" srcset="https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104112/squat-form.jpg 604w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104112/squat-form-400x230.jpg 400w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104112/squat-form-600x345.jpg 600w, https://sifuochwingchun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/24104112/squat-form-300x172.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" /></p>
<p>Just as the weight lifting supports his weight with structure, the Wing Chun Fighter supports his power through his alignment. Following the same rules through physiques the weight is on the heel when engaged. This allows strikes at full power to be stopped and maximum strength can be delivered through blows.</p>
<h3>Toes</h3>
<p>Even though the heels are the source of power and structure, speed is seriously inhibited when the weight is focused there. Weight should only be distributed to the toes when looking to utilize speed. Speed is used to gain the correct position. This is typically done before contact is even made. Once connected to your opponent weight should immediately be transferred to the heels to again for power. Closing the distance with an opponent is essential to the Wing Chun Fighter. If he is unable to get to the trapping range it will be difficult to execute proper techniques.</p>
<h2>Stance Distribution</h2>
<p>The final aspect of weight distribution to cover is the amount of weight on each foot.&nbsp; At Sifu Och Wing Chun we typically keep our weight 50-50. The reason behind this is to keep our ability to defend against takedowns. If the weight is distributed to far to one leg you can become susceptible to those types of attacks. Sweeps and single leg takedowns are difficult to stop without even distribution of weight.</p>
<p>To give a specific example, we will look at a single leg takedown&nbsp;defense. First, hand positions: jum to the neck, gan to the arm. (Essentially a Gan Da). This will then become a tan and a fook. The Jum to the neck stops the person from getting to your core. The gan to the arm is used to block them from getting your leg. As a result you gain&nbsp;an underhook. (illustrated below).</p>

<p>In unison the foot that is being attacked must be retracted. The foot must be swept back to avoid getting caught. This all occurs within a split second. If the weight split 70-30, or 60-40, it will be very hard to adjust and defend this type of attack.</p>
<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are many different opinions and reasons about weight distribution. At Sifu Och Wing Chun we keep it mostly 50-50 to maintain the ability to adjust in any direction as quickly as possible. We are then able to shift and adapt to any attack that is thrown our way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Is the school you are attending or considering a fraud? In order to determine if a martial arts school is a fraud, you first have to be able to recognize what a good school looks like. There are a few different aspects of a martial arts school that may indicate a fraud. How the school handles money matters, their credibility, and the techniques they teach are among the most pressing factors to consider when choosing a school. Let this article help you in Spotting Martial Art Frauds.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Money Matters</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Consider all of the different areas that the school is asking you to invest your money in. Tuition, testing fees, merchandise, and seminars are all fairly typical of most martial arts schools; however, it is certainly possible to abuse any one of these. For example: tuition is a necessary part of any school, but if you notice that the school is regularly raising tuition (with a nod to the economy) or refusing to grandfather in older students, that may indicate a problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Almost anyone that goes into the martial arts does so to be able to improve themselves in some way, but that way does not for everyone include testing. It will likewise raise suspicions if testing is mandatory, outrageously priced, and or more frequent than every few months. There is no inherent need for a school to evaluate your progress more often than that. If the instructor feels like it is truly necessary to assess your skill for one reason or another, they can do it without charging you a testing fee.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Credibility</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Is the school credible? Certificates can be fabricated and people have been known to lie. So how do you know if a school or instructor has the credentials they claim? If you are serious about finding out, the best answer lies in a quick phone call or email. Contacting the association that your school is claiming accreditation from can quickly verify that claim. Where it gets tricky is trying to determine which associations are credible and whether they actually have any authority to be giving credibility in the first place. Some schools will lack accreditation of any kind and claim to be independent schools in their own right. Though this may denote a scam, it is not necessarily cause to abandon ship; these schools may in humility not seek awards or accreditation. In this case you would have to look to other factors to determine credibility.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Technique and Instruction</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">If all of the above checks out, the school deals with money fairly and has credibility on their side. The next order of business is are their techniques realistic and are they taught in an effective way? ¬¬If the school is teaching a jump-spin-round kick as an effective means to take out your opponents head, the school may be a fraud with delusional instructors. On the other hand, if they are teaching this same kick while explicitly telling students it is only for showmanship and fun, that is another story.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There is nothing wrong with practicing showy moves, so long as the student is not deluded to its practicality. And with every move, the student needs time to drill in order for those techniques. The goal is so that they become a part of them (so why not focus on the more practical ones?). Many fraudulent schools forgo drilling to excess in an effort to keep students from becoming bored and disengaged. A good school will find ways to make drilling less of a drag, but will nonetheless drill like crazy.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Spotting Martial Art Frauds</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are many different factors that may indicate a fraudulent martial arts school. Just because a school possesses one of these traits doesn’t make them a fraud. But when a school starts to have two or three of the warning signs, it may be time to look somewhere else. Each school will have its own opinions and practices, just make sure that whatever school you choose you are proud to call it your own.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><!-- @page { margin: 0.79in } P { margin-bottom: 0.08in } --></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: medium;">When broken up, martial is referred to as “those inclined to war or fighting”.&nbsp; Art is referred to as “the expression or</span> <span style="font-size: medium;">creative skill and imagination”. Thus, martial arts is to be translated as “the expression of creative fighting skills”. Some (possibly the majority) of the practices still firmly embrace this concept.&nbsp; However there are other practices that use martial arts as a catalyst and add it with the practices philosophy in order to create a new self. In this part of our two part series titled &#8220;Martial Arts Philosophy-Chinese Versus Japanese Part 1&#8221;, we will cover the Chinese side of the two lines of thinking.<br />
</span></h3>
<div id="TextSection" dir="LTR">
<h3><span style="font-size: medium;">Martial = inclined to war or fighting </span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-size: medium;">Art = expression or creative skill</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER"><span style="font-size: medium;">Martial Arts = Expressive or Creative Skill in Fighting </span></h3>
<h2 style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER"><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Chinese Martial Arts</b></span></span></h2>
</div>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Despite it having a combat effectiveness, Kung Fu (also pronounced Gung Fu) is founded on the philosophy of attaining intelligence and wisdow. Two qualities that take years to develop and attain. Additionally, the first character, Kung, when translated, means “training intensely” or “skillful work”. Translation of the second character, fu, refers to “time spent”. Together, Kung Fu may be translated as “time spent training hard” or “spending time on skillful work”. By this translation it is somewhat difficult to pin kung fu (time spent working hard) solely to martial arts (creative skill of fighting). Rather Kung Fu is referring to a skill or skills in a variety of subjects, and not just martial arts affiliated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kung (Gung) = Skillful work </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Fu = Time Spent</span></p>
<p align="CENTER"><span style="font-size: medium;">Kung Fu (Gung Fu) = Time Spent on Skillful Work</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER">Kung Fu</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">For instance, in today’s time when one speaks of Kung Fu, those involved immediately perceive it as martial arts—more specifically Chinese martial arts. However, this view contradicts the literal translation of kung fu as it predicates to a single subject. Kung fu is a meaning of achievement in a subject; be it in medicine, industry, mathematics, culinary or martial arts. It represents the training process that one had to go through—the strengthening of mind and body, the learning and the knowledge gained from it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Take for example one that acquires self-achievement in the knowledge of medicine through a long period of time; in comparison, there may be slight difference from one that acquired self-achievement in a martial art. Considering that both went through intense years and massive amounts of effort to reach their goal, it is difficult to deny that both carry kung fu skills. In this case you would say that the person has kung fu in medicine and the other person’s kung fu is in martial arts. </span></p>
<h2>Kung fu to Wushu</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The misuse of the word kung fu traces back to the misinterpretation of the word in Asian movie dubbings and subtitles. Since then Westerners often use it in its false pretense and is even defined the same way in the Oxford English Dictionary. Asia, even China, adopted the English definition of kung fu in the late twentieth century. The accurate term used that describes Chinese martial arts is Wu Shu. Wu, when translated, means “war”, and shu translates to “art”. Fully translated, wu shu means “the art of war” (which is also the title of Sun Tzu’s well known book).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Wu = War Shu = Art</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"> Wu Shu = the Art of War </span></p>
<h2>Chinese Martial art roots</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Much of the philosophy that Chinese martial arts follows is deeply rooted in eastern religious doctrines. The three that has the greatest impact in the evolution of Chinese martial arts are Daoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. What Chinese martial arts took from Daoism is the important teaching of the harmony between Yin and Yang. It is universal that for something to exist it will have an opposing force. Buddhism teaches the importance of all life and the need of one avoiding suffering through self-cultivation. Its use of practicing self-defense and learning make it an essential aspect in Chinese martial arts. </span></p>

<h2>Body Trinity</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">It also focuses on three aspects that make the human: the spirit, mind and body (some may refer to it as the “trinity”).</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> The body contains all that we are—all that we are made up of—the legs, arms, torso, etc. although it may be a healthy body it is an instrument that can be improved upon. The mind is what drives us to live the lives we live and is fed with knowledge and information. Feeding it positive information will have a parallel effect on the body and will greater ones existence. </span></p>
<p><strong>There is specific amount of time that it takes to achieve &#8220;kung fu&#8221; in Chinese arts. For some it may take a single decade, others it may take many! It all depends on your effort and dedication!</strong></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The straight punch, or jab, is a widely used technique used in almost every existing martial art. Though different arts may vary slightly in how they deliver this technique, the biggest difference lies in how they defend against it. Some martial arts will block the blow with a stagnant defense.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif"><span style="font-size: medium">The straight punch, or jab, is a widely used technique used in almost every existing martial art. Though different arts may vary slightly in how they deliver this technique, the biggest difference lies in how they defend against it. Some martial arts will block the blow with a stagnant defense. Others will avoid contact completely by dodging or evading by moving in or to the side. This article will analyze how some of the most popular martial arts in the world defend against that attack.<br />
</span></span></p>
<h2>Martial Arts Punch Defense Variations</h2>
<h3><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif"><span style="font-size: medium"><b>Tae Kwon Do, Karate and Muay Thai </b></span></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif"><span style="font-size: medium">Tae Kwon Do, Karate, and Muay Thai are similar in their defense of punches in that they block the attack in a hard stop that accepts much of the energy. The most popular punch defense in Tae Kwon Do is either an in-to-outside or an out-to-inside block. To perform this block, one will start in the guard, one arm across the body and the other fist up by the face, by bringing the front arm either from the outside-in or inside-out of the body; this pushes the punch off course. Karate starts from the same guard, but will employ a box block. The box block will move up, down, left or right, but only by a few inches; choosing to take an angle so that not so much force is necessary. In Muay Thai, the most common punch defense is accepting the blow to the guard. To form the guard, one will place both fists on the forehead while keeping the elbows in tight. The Muay Thai practitioner may turn slightly to deflect some of the blow, but the guard will absorb most of the blow.</span></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif"><span style="font-size: medium"><b>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Aikido, and Judo</b></span></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif"><span style="font-size: medium">These martial arts prefer to take an angle to the oncoming offense, desiring to not incur quite as much damage. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) defends mostly against ground techniques, though they acknowledge that most fights will start in stand-up. A BJJ practitioner may dodge the punch altogether, coming in with a take-down. To handle punches from the ground, much like the Muay Thai practitioner, one will use a guard. Aikido is all about redirecting energy in a circular fashion. The Aikido practitioner may block to the outside of the opponents hand, continuing the momentum in a circle – usually ending in some kind of lock. Judo, like BJJ, does not like to address the punch directly. A Judo practitioner may side step the punch, following through with some form of lock or wrist manipulation.</span></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif"><span style="font-size: medium"><b>Krav Maga and&nbsp;</b>Wing Chun</span></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif"><span style="font-size: medium">Krav Maga and Wing Chun fall somewhere in the middle of our previous two groups in their defense against punches; both desire minimal movement, taking the path of least resistance. In Krav Maga, a practitioner will start with both hands open and in front of the face, stepping to the side and pushing one hand out to meet the oncoming punch; directing it off target. Wing Chun will start off similarly to Krav Maga, with both hands open and up by the face, though one hand will be reaching farther out than the other. The hand closest to the oncoming punch will push out, palm up, commanding the space that the opponents punch was in. An alternative to that is to intercept it with a straight punch of their own.<br />
</span></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif"><span style="font-size: medium"><b>Conclusion</b></span></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif"><span style="font-size: medium">All of these martial arts will teach more than one way to defend against a punch, and can by no means be boxed into a few sentences. Each of these examples, rather, displays the arts’ mentality when defending a punch – which can be just as important as the actual move. Whether your goal is to stop a punch in its’ tracks, redirect it, or dodge it completely, being able to defend against a straight punch is a necessity in any art. </span></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I think of the many devastating Wing Chun Kung Fu techniques that I have learned so far, I realized that while these techniques can be applied to hard targets of the body, delivering&nbsp;them to soft targets increases their effectiveness. Let me explain&nbsp;the difference between a hard target and a soft target. Basically, a soft target defines&nbsp;any part of the body vulnerable to attack due to its lack of natural protection. It either&nbsp;lacks protection by the body, or has&nbsp;a high amount of nerve bundles/pain receptors in&nbsp;the target area.</p>
<h2>Defining a Soft Target</h2>
<p>An area falls under&nbsp;vulnerable soft targets when&nbsp;it isn’t covered by thick skin, tough muscle or hard bone. Examples are:</p>
<h3>The Eyes</h3>
<p>The only protection that the eyes have are the eyelids. The thin skin of the eyelids leaves the eyes open to attack even when the eyelids are shut.</p>
<p>Some useful Wing Chun attacking techniques to the eyes include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/wing-chun-biu-jee-thrusting-fingers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Biu Jee (Thrusting fingers)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/phoenix-eye-fist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phoenix Eye fist punch</a> (Protruding Knuckle punch)</li>
<li>Thumb gouge</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Throat</h3>
<p>The throat includes the sides where the carotid arteries are located. It also includes the jugular notch—the indentation under the Adam’s apple. If the carotid arteries are attacked, the victim could be rendered unconscious from the momentary loss of blood-flow to the brain. The jugular notch is effective as it doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;require much force or pressure to cause someone pain. Hitting it also results in difficulty of breathing.</p>
<p>Some useful Wing Chun attacking techniques to the throat include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faak Sau Chop (uses outside of hand)</li>
<li>Knife-hand Strike (uses the boney part of the inside of the hand)</li>
<li>Turning backfist</li>
<li>Phoenix Eye punch (a protruding knuckle punch)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Soft Targets Above and Below</h2>
<h3>The Lips&nbsp;and Mouth</h3>
<p>The areas around the lips and mouth are naturally made of soft tissue/ They have no real protection except the skin that covers them. A forceful blow to the lips&nbsp;and mouth will drive the lips into the teeth causing painful injury to the soft flesh of the mouth. It will also be likely that the teeth will be affected as well.</p>
<p>Some useful Wing Chun attacking techniques to the lips&nbsp;and mouth include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wang Jeung (Upward forward palm heel strike)</li>
<li>Chain punches</li>
<li>Turning backfist</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Groin</h3>
<p>Though this area is a more vulnerable soft target area for men, women also have nerve bundles in the groin area. Attacking these soft targets&nbsp;causes real pain. The groin is also a great soft target area for attacking a male, especially in self-defense situations. This is simply because of the fact that only skin protects the male organs. You can inflict a&nbsp;great amount of pain to the groin without needing a source of great strength or power.</p>
<p>Some useful Wing Chun attacking techniques to the groin area include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fish Kick (a quick upward front kick with the top of the foot)</li>
<li>Elbow strikes</li>
<li>Knee strikes</li>
<li>Uppercut punches</li>
<li>Tok Sau Strike (Upward cupping hand)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Concluding Thoughts</h2>
<p>A&nbsp;Wing Chun style punch delivered straight to the cheek will cause a great deal of damage. Imagine, however, how incapacitating that same technique would be if you delivered the punch to one of the soft target areas?&nbsp;Of course, in sparring, many if not all of these techniques would be illegal. They remain&nbsp;unsportsmanlike at the very least, and we don&#8217;t ever recommend their use. However, if one is using one of the above techniques in self-defense from an attacker, then all rules are off. You can, <em>and should,</em> do everything&nbsp;necessary to protect yourself.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Just how much attention are you paying to your surroundings? Having good situational awareness of your surroundings and being aware is very important.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve all heard the saying, “The best defense is a good offense.” Well, a good offense begins with having good situational awareness of your surroundings and being&nbsp;aware. Being aware of the people, the vehicles, the number and location of exits of the building you are in, etc can all mean the difference between becoming a target and avoiding an attack. We must train ourselves to always be aware. It&#8217;s not just for at night. Situational awareness isn&#8217;t&nbsp;only&nbsp;when you&#8217;re&nbsp;in strange areas. It&#8217;s also&nbsp;not just for when walking to your car. Situational awareness is needed at all times.</p>
<p>How often are you aware of your surroundings? In general, most people think they have a pretty good idea of what&nbsp;surrounds them while out and about. If you&#8217;re honest with yourself, you may be surprised at&nbsp;what you may have overlooked. Think about the about the last time you left a shopping center. Now&nbsp;ask yourself these questions:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>How many people were sitting in their cars as you were leaving the shopping center? If so, what were they doing?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Did you walk by any trucks? Did any of them have open truck beds? If so, were you walking close enough to that truck that someone could have jumped out of it and grabbed you?</em></p>
<h2>Living With Better Situational Awareness</h2>
<p>Granted, most people sitting inside their cars or who happen to drive a truck are not out to attack anyone. Still, it&#8217;s better to be aware of the potential for a problem to arise than to assume there never will be one. Both of these first two awareness situations can also be practiced with your children. Make it a game. Ask your kids to count how many people they noticed who were sitting in their cars. How many pick-up trucks did they count on the way to their own car?</p>
<p>Were your hands full as you walked to your car? Would you be able to use them to defend yourself?&nbsp;When&nbsp;possible, use a shopping cart to transport your bags to your car. Not only does this give distance between yourself and a would-be attacker, but the shopping cart can be pushed into an attacker if the need arises.</p>
<p>Did you have your keys ready and in your hand before you left the shopping center?&nbsp;Always have your keys in your hand before you leave the relative safety of the shopping center, building, etc.</p>
<p>Were you on your phone (texting, talking, playing a game, etc.) as you walked to your car?</p>
<h2>Stay Alert When Walking</h2>
<p>Keep your head up and avail yourself the use of all of your senses. Don&#8217;t use your phone as you walk to your car.<br />
Whether your hands are weighed down with shopping bags, you have to reach into your pocket or purse for your keys, or you&#8217;re on the phone, you&#8217;re distracted—even&nbsp;if only for a few seconds. An assailant can use those seconds to spring an attack when your awareness is compromised.</p>
<p>Situational awareness extends well beyond just leaving a location and getting to your car safely. You need to learn to extend your realm of awareness into all areas. Other situations and ideas for using situational awareness will be discussed in a further article.</p>
<p>Practicing situational awareness is a great starting point to decrease your chances of becoming the victim of an attack. However, if you <em>are</em> attacked you will need to have the skills to defend yourself. That&#8217;s where <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/marketing/wing-chun-kung-fu-classes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wing Chun kung fu classes</a> come into play. Sifu Och Wing Chun can help you learn to protect yourself and those you love.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“C&#8217;mon man, you do martial arts right? Well, let me see what you got!” “Are you scared? Kung Fu is supposed to be good.” “Dude, a good boxer could beat your Karate any day.” These types of phrases are dangerous. Like a cattle prod used against lion or tiger, they only mean to instigate trouble. Due to other people&#8217;s inability to to let go of their ego and understand the nuances of training, it&#8217;s best to avoid letting others know your skill. As martial artists we should do everything in our power to promote peace. Your own martial arts secret helps you&nbsp;accomplish this. When forced to protect yourself or someone else,&nbsp;use every means necessary to win.</p>
<h2>The other guy</h2>
<p align="LEFT">As you travel on your journey there are a couple of reasons you should keep your own arts secret. First, if you&#8217;re confronted because you train, you may lose. Why is that first? Because you don&#8217;t know what the other guy knows,&nbsp;or you may be a beginner. You may have learned many techniques and practiced how to apply them. However, it takes years to develop full muscle memory and synchronization with the techniques. 10,000 repetitions is the average amount to master a technique and that&#8217;s not including learning timing and distance. Combine that with the need to learn reaction training, and it&#8217;s best to avoid conflict as much as possible.</p>
<h2 align="LEFT">Your Own Martial Arts Secret &#8211;&nbsp;USE Every Advantage</h2>
<p align="LEFT">There&#8217;s a second reason to keep your art a secret.&nbsp;Wing Chun is a <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/sensible-self-defense-lakeland-fl/">sensible self defense</a> system.&nbsp;If you divulge your skill you have empowered the opponent. How so, you may ask? If confronted by a wrestler, you might&nbsp;have the mindset prepared to watch for a takedown. Maybe feint to the head with a jab or something similar and then a single leg. Knowing this would allow me to position myself in a way to avoid or stop his attack. So following suit, you should keep every advantage possible. <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/testimonials/prior-martial-arts-training-kickboxing-brazilian-jiujitsu-karate-muay-thai/">Martial arts</a> is about deception. If you can deceive your opponent into believing you have no skill, he will not set&nbsp;his guard as high. At the minimum it will keep him guessing. That&nbsp;could be just the edge needed to win.</p>
<h2 align="LEFT">Actions not words</h2>
<p align="LEFT">The final reason involves talking to friends. Many times questioning your art comes from a point of disbelief. Even after you have soundly answered a question, more always follow. They will counter it with &#8220;but what if this happens, or that&#8221; over and over again. Certain types of people don&#8217;t really want an answer. They&nbsp;either want to prove they know something or that your art doesn&#8217;t work.&nbsp; I bring this up because of personal experience. Certain techniques use pain to bring a reaction which would be followed up. Techniques such as these cannot merely be explain, they must be experience to fully understand them.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If one shows this to a certain type of person they will be unable to cope with it and will increase the resistance level. The practitioner must either give in or increase the energy level. If someone does not concede, it will typically end in a confrontation. The non-practitioner will not have the discipline to concede so your art may end up looking weak. So the choices are grim. Hurt your friend and risk losing the friendship or concede and allow your art to look weak. Speaking in general terms of course. Therefore, the classroom is the best place for any such teaching.</p>
<p align="LEFT">These three reasons are why I believe you should keep your own&nbsp;martial&nbsp;arts secret. Most people find it difficult&nbsp;to let go of their pride. You don&#8217;t know what the other guy knows. And you don&#8217;t want to give away your advantage. Keep these things in mind as you walk through life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throughout martial art history there has always been a quest for the final move. The ultimate takedown of any opponent no matter the size. Unfortunately, such a technique does not exist. Nor is there an art that is the end all to other arts. However, within one&#8217;s art there can exist techniques which can provide simple answers to complicated questions. Since Wing Chun is about being direct and simple we should always seek the most efficient choice. We also don&#8217;t want to leave ourselves open to <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/wing-chun-weakness-part-ii/">Wing Chun weaknesses</a>. I only had a weekend to show you three techniques, these are what I would choose. They are simple enough to learn within that weekend but they are also effective enough to make a big difference. So you must learn these three moves:&nbsp;Intercepting Fist, Jum Sao, and the Inside Low Shadow Kick.</p>
<h2 align="LEFT">Learn these Three Moves</h2>
<h3 align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000000;">Intercepting Fist</span></h3>

<p align="LEFT">The Intercepting Fist does exactly what it&#8217;s name implies: it intercepts a strike instead of blocking. With the proper timing there is no need to block and then attack which makes this a very dangerous technique. Firing off the <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/wing-chun-centerline-theory2/">Wing Chun&nbsp;centerline</a> with a shift of the body it is powerful and effective. It uses the forearm to deflect an oncoming strike off the line. When deflected it allows the fist to continue on it&#8217;s course to the intended target. This strike is used mainly against attacks coming down the middle in a straight line. Curved attacks need something else, bringing me to the next move.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Jum Sao, one of the most versatile techniques in all of Wing Chun. It can be used against almost any initial strike. Driving from the elbow with a reverse L shape it can be used to deflect straight punches (jabs and crosses etc), uppercuts, and even front kicks. When doubled up, two Jum Saos simultaneously, it can be used to block outside kicks: Roundhouses Etc. It can even be used to assist in takedown defense! Not only does it stop the straight attacks but it can be used against wild hooks (not tight hooks) as a last resort. With it&#8217;s wide range of uses the Jum is a must for the Wing Chun practitioner!</p>

<p align="LEFT">To finish off the trio I want to present the Inside Low Shadow Kick. Comparable to a stomp, it can be used to stop other kicks, blow out knees, and break ankles. Since it is kept low it is hard to see coming and can be used very quickly off the front foot. The foot turned away from the body it uses the heel to drive through the intended target. The most common target is the inside or outside of the knee. When combined with a deflection or strike it is near impossible to avoid or stop.</p>
<h2 align="LEFT">Conclusion</h2>
<p align="LEFT">So there you have it! Intercepting Fist, Jum Sao, and Inside Low Shadow Kick. Wing Chun&#8217;s knowledge goes deep; there are many effective and powerful techniques. However these three standout due to their simplicity. Learn these three moves and your Wing Chun will have a solid base. Be simple, direct, and devastating!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When training for self defense many&nbsp;devote&nbsp;a lot of focus to technique. Surviving a tense situation requires repetition until you achieve perfection. But when the situation goes beyond your fighting fitness, techniques become sloppy, slower, and the danger level rises with each passing moment.&nbsp;Asking the question: &#8220;Are you fit to fight?&#8221; and knowing your personal fighting fitness is something you want to do <em>before</em> it matters.</p>
<p>There is a reason that professional MMA fighters are so dangerous. It&#8217;s not just their technique and skill, but they are athletes in every sense of the word. They push themselves to their physical limits every day of training to prepare for their matches. Obviously, most people don&#8217;t have the time to devote to the same regiment as an athlete. Fitting in training time for self defense techniques is a challenge. Take into account&nbsp;families, work, and any other activities, and you begin to see the problem. Still,&nbsp;when dealing with an attacker, remember that he or she may not be alone. Will your training last you past the first attacker, on to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th? What if you must carry an injured friend to safety? You want to ask these type of questions early to bring some reality into your training.</p>
<h2>Building Fighting Fitness into TraIning</h2>
<p>At <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com">Sifu Och Wing Chun</a>, we build some of the fitness needed for scenarios like this&nbsp;right&nbsp;into our&nbsp;actual training. But to compliment the Wing Chun, Sifu Och includes a HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) regiment within his schedule just before his <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/classes/lakeland-kickboxing-weight-loss-bootcamp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kickboxing class</a> to maximize cardio. Once students have pushed themselves to their limit, they can then&nbsp;begin increasing their cardio within the Wing Chun training. You cannot initiate hypertrophy in a muscle by going to its limit and stopping. You actually need to&nbsp;overload the muscle <em>past</em> its limit to get&nbsp;growth. The same goes for cardio. You want to take your training&nbsp;to the limit, and then push through that to increase the endurance capacity.</p>
<p>If a student is sparring, and they reach their cardio limit,&nbsp;it begins to manifest itself in weaker strikes and slower reaction time. In a situation hinging on split-second decisions, there&#8217;s no room for errors. One second could make the difference between life or death. Your fighting&nbsp;fitness level is your gas tank. The bigger the gas tank, the longer the drive. Without gas, your car goes nowhere. Without adequate fighting fitness, you go nowhere&#8230;.Fast.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Building a solid Wing Chun foundation reminds me of a biblical parable and&nbsp;the house built on the sand:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;&#8230;And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: right;"><strong>&#8211;&nbsp;Matthew 7:27</strong></p>
<h2>Biblical Truths Can Be Applied to Your Training</h2>
<p>This&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A24-29&amp;version=ESV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">parable from the Bible</a> speaks about a&nbsp;man who&nbsp;built his house on the sand. It fell as soon as pressure from the storm and winds came. Before that, the verse speaks&nbsp;of the man who&nbsp;built his house on the rock. It stood firm under the tempest. The same goes for your training! Without good structure, techniques will not have a solid base from which to operate. They will collapse under the weight of an opponent that has developed their structure.</p>
<h3>Yee Chi Kimyeung Ma &#8211; The First Form</h3>
<p>Wing Chun uses Yee Chi Kimyeung Ma with its first form and many drills. This helps&nbsp;develop the student&#8217;s structure within the very&nbsp;first steps. Teaching students to root through the heels and keep their hips tucked underneath their spine allows for the lower body to be “rooted” into the ground.&nbsp;This is exactly the same theory as when one is finishing a squat. With the proper structure aligned through the spine, the student can now work on combining the hand techniques with the lower body structure.</p>
<p>With this combination, nearly any attack can be withstood! But this adjustment doesn&#8217;t come overnight. Something as integral as structure takes a long time to not only learn, but understand how to tap into that correct structure for power and strength. But why is this so hard? What could be so difficult about tucking in your hips?</p>
<h2>The Difference with Wing Chun Foundation</h2>
<p>As we grow as humans, from the very first step we learn to lean and press from our toes to walk. As we play sports and go through P.E. We always hear, “be on your toes” from our coaches. So the body is programed to learn to draw power from the toes from very early on. Structurally, however, this isn&#8217;t optimal location to withstand weight. With the balls of the toes being the primary source of contact, instead of utilizing the bones for structure, the calf and tibialus anterior is now recruited to stabilize the rest of the body.</p>
<p>The ability to withstand pressure is no longer contingent on the alignment of the bones of the body, but the muscle strength of the individual. Therefore, utilizing the <em>toes</em> as the contact point for structure is <em>not</em> the best option for the smaller fighter. Since it&#8217;s been recruited for so long, the body will not understand how to draw power from the heels without constant and consistent training.</p>
<h2>Drilling Until It&#8217;s Second Nature</h2>
<p>When practicing to develop any technique there are two (arguably three, with some) stages to learning and using a new skill: Programming and applying. When programming a new skill, first the user must be made aware of how to make the proper skeletal adjustments and where bad habits are manifesting. Once the awareness has been raised, the student can now practice to make the adjustments automatic. After the new technique has been programmed, it must be refined under pressure in the application portion of training. Just as gold is refined under fire, so will structure manifest itself when real, strong pressure it used against it! Once t&#8217;s tested over, and over, and over again, it will settle in with the mind-body connection.</p>
<p>So, you must decide. With your training, when the tempests come, and you are tested, will you have a strong house built on a rock?&nbsp;Or will you settle for one built on the sand? Find a good blueprint, and then work, work, work to make that house impregnable.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Would you like fries with that sash? Do you consider online certified sifus to be real, genuine teachers? We don't. Be sure to really investigate who you're training under.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/online-certified-sifus-bad/">Online Certified Sifus &#8211; Bad or Convenient?</a> appeared first on <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com">Sifu Och Wing Chun</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many ways to get martial arts “certifications” online. Options range from eBay to online courses in&nbsp;<a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/marketing/wing-chun-kung-fu-classes/">Wing Chun Kung Fu</a>,&nbsp;Brazilian Jiujitsu, or&nbsp;a host of other styles. In this day and&nbsp;age, it can be as easy as paying a fee, taking&nbsp;some online courses, and getting your Instructor level sash. Do you consider online certified sifus&nbsp;to be real,&nbsp;genuine teachers? We don&#8217;t. If one&nbsp;opens a school and begins teaching, how do students know if this is the best&nbsp;person to give their money to? We have some suggestions.</p>
<h2>Online Certified Sifus &#8211; Would You Like Fries With That Sash?</h2>
<p>Is there a real check and balance on these online certifications? Are they truly doing any real training? Or, are they simply “buying” their certification and then coming out the other end as a “certified” Wing Chun instructor? Online certified sifus represent an unfortunate, growing, problem in martial arts.</p>
<p>My sifu, <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/instructors/sifu-justin-och-chief-wing-chun-instructor/">Sifu Justin Och</a> was trained in person by each of his Masters through weekly group classes and private lessons. Typically, I have a hard time believing that you can get the same full understanding without touching the hands of an advanced instructor on a weekly or even daily basis. However, does that mean that online Wing Chun training can&#8217;t be beneficial? No,&nbsp;but&nbsp;getting &#8220;certified&#8221; as a Sifu through online training&nbsp;doesn&#8217;t seem to be worth&nbsp;much more than the paper it comes with.</p>
<p>We can all agree it&#8217;s getting too easy to buy your way (or even fraud your way) into everything from certifications to Hall of Fames. But does that make online training certifications and weekend seminar courses &#8220;fraudulent&#8221;? Does this make your <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/is-your-sifu-a-fraud-or-the-real-deal/">sifu a fraud</a>? That depends on what questions you&#8217;re asking, and what answers you&#8217;re getting in return.</p>
<h2>Do Your Research</h2>
<p>Some instructors are out for the rank, but they aren’t willing to put in the years of work, time, effort, and devotion to truly earn their title. <strong>Do your research.</strong> Don’t be afraid to run a background check on your potential instructor. You need to know who you&#8217;re going to be devoting yourself to as your sifu. Be informed, and don’t be afraid to ask questions.</p>
<p>If your sifu’s certifications are reputable, then the next thing you need to look at is how the instructor teaches. Some martial arts instructors have been trained extremely well, but are not gifted with the ability to communicate that training to others. This is an unfortunate situation. It&#8217;s not going to be a productive environment for you if you cannot learn or properly understand the techniques. Unfortunately, some instructors try to hide this lack of teaching ability by having their assistant instructors teach the classes. Don’t be afraid to ask who actively leads the classes that you&#8217;re interested in taking. If you&#8217;re paying for a quality sifu level instructor to teach you, then be sure that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re getting.</p>
<h3>Personal Training and Improvement</h3>
<p>If you can see your sifu is qualified with legitimate certifications and has the gift to be able to teach others, then the next thing I would look for is how the Sifu trains and keeps his own skills sharp. If I&#8217;m seeking <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/testimonials/wing-chun-training-family/">Wing Chun training</a> from an instructor, then I expect my sifu to take his <em>own</em> training seriously. Does he still train on his own to keep his skills fresh? Does he meet periodically with other sifus so they can&nbsp;exchange ideas and learn from each other? If your sifu is still showing personal motivation and devotion to his own development and growth in Wing Chun, then he will be able to pass this same dedication on to you!</p>
<h2>Digging Deeper</h2>
<p>I did the same thing I&#8217;m telling you now before I began training with my instructor, Sifu Justin Och. I checked his background—all of it. Next, I contacted the people he got his sifu level from. Finally, I even checked on his overseas visits with other grandmasters and instructors.</p>
<p>After my research, I have no doubts that my&nbsp;Sifu, Justin Och, is the real deal. He was not trained online. Sifu Och&nbsp;was trained in person through weekly group and private lessons for many years. He was tested and certified under master’s from 4 different <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/ip-man/">Ip Man Wing Chun</a> lineages (Moy Yat, Ip Chun, Ip Ching, and Simon Lau) after years of arduous training according to his master.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.worldvingtsun.com/schools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Ving Tsun Athletic Association</a>, a group of Wing Chun Kung Fu masters and grandmasters appointed him as the Regional Director for the Southeastern USA. Sifu Och&nbsp;trains in Jui-Jitsu with black belts in BJJ and has had a professional MMA fighter and black belt in BJJ as his coach for years. Sifu Justin Och has traveled to <strong>11 countries</strong> seeking out the full understanding of Wing Chun Kung Fu. This is on top of being <strong>three times certified as a Sifu</strong> in the Wing Chun system.</p>
<h3>International Training</h3>
<p>His travels have expanded his own Wing Chun training, and he brings that training back home to his Lakeland, Florida students. He has even met and rolled Chi Sao hands with Ip Chun (eldest son of Ip Man).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The thought of causing another human being serious, devastating, potentially life threatening damage is not a pleasant thing to think about. The average person doesn&#8217;t bring those thoughts to the forefront of their mind to&nbsp;examine. So then, how does one develop the mindset to hurt someone else if it&nbsp;came to&nbsp;that? Motivation to do anything in life comes from one thing, the “why”. So&nbsp;when it&#8217;s life or death,&nbsp;what do you do?</p>
<h2>Understanding The &#8220;Why&#8221;</h2>
<p>Why? Why would you want to lose weight? And why would you want to stay up till 4am doing work? Why would you persevere through trials with seemingly no end in sight? When that “why” can be answered, the mind will fall into place and actions will follow. So how do you find the&nbsp;answer to such a heavy question?</p>
<p>When it comes to your life, you have to understand what it&#8217;s worth—to yourself and to others. We as humans were created with a purpose, to make life beautiful, to make this world a better place. Your part in this world is something you have to discover! No one has the right to take that away from you! But what if we look past ourselves? Who is depending on you to come home and take care of them? What will they do if you are not around? Now the situation has surpassed just yourself and your desires.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s&nbsp;move along that same line of thinking but get our thoughts off of ourselves. Here is something else to ponder: What about the next victim? If you don&#8217;t take action do you think that this person will magically change their ways after they have had their way with you? Absolutely not! There will always be another victim unless they are stopped! And that person to stop them could be you! You could be the one to protect the next person before anything even happens to them. If you have an opportunity to stop evil in its tracks you should take it because the next victim may not get that chance.</p>
<p>Once someone crosses the line of crime they are more likely to commit another crime. According to the Association for Psychological Science, “Within three years of being released from Jail, two out of every three inmates in the US wind up behind bars again”. Two out of three is a staggering statistic, and that is only based on criminals getting caught. Who knows, maybe YOUR life was spared because someone else stepped up and stopped someone and you will never know about it.</p>
<h2>Life or Death Decisions Matter</h2>
<p>In the moment, there is no time for thinking, no hesitation. Your mind must have already accepted what must be done when the time comes. There can be no room left for error. So what are you doing to prepare for such a moment? If you have never trained your mind and your body to handle such a situation do you really believe that in the moment you will suddenly spring to action as if you were magically imbued with abilities you never had before? Of course not! It is foolish to believe so!</p>
<p>It would be the same if you were placed into any sporting match believe you will suddenly be able to not only play with your teammates but also beat the other team. You must train, you must prepare, you must be ready, you must decide now. Find your why, let it guide you, and then be follow through with action. Find a good master, train hard, and become more than you are now! Become the person others can come to depend on.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Regardless of the style of martial arts you practice, sooner or later you&#8217;ll get injured. It’s not a question of <em>if</em> you’re going to get hurt as you pursue your path in martial arts. It’s just a matter of <em>when</em>&nbsp;(and how badly). You don’t have to be a full-contact Mixed Martial Arts practitioner in order to experience the bruises, sprains, muscle tears, and even possible bone-breaks that come with training in the field of Martial Arts. The big question is what you do with these. Are injuries in martial arts a setback or opportunity?</p>
<p>That may depend on your attitude.</p>
<h2>Injuries in Martial Arts &#8211; It&#8217;s Gonna Happen</h2>
<p>Every style, from TaeKwonDo and&nbsp;Karate to Kung Fu, is going to involve some level of aggressive physical contact. This can result in minor (or, occasionally, major) injuries. When that injury does come along, <em>and it will</em>, how you choose to handle it can mean the difference between a setback or an opportunity.</p>
<p>Depending on the severity of your injury, you may not be able to fully participate as much as you could before the injury. However, as you allow yourself the time to heal, that doesn’t mean you can’t train at all. Whatever the injury, you should give that damaged area a chance to mend. Not allowing your body the time it needs to repair itself could lead to permanent damage, so you will need to avoid using the injured area.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to consult your martial arts instructor for advice on how to handle an&nbsp;injury. He or she has probably seen many different types of trauma. Always consult a doctor’s advice if you have any doubts about how to best treat and heal your injury.</p>
<h2>The Mental Game</h2>
<p>Now, comes your chance to decide how you will mentally handle the fact that you are not going to be able to train like you had before the trauma. You have a few choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can mope and bemoan your situation until you heal.</li>
<li>You can ask your martial arts instructor or other students about how they would handle the injury.</li>
<li>You can give up on martial arts altogether.</li>
<li>You can look at the abilities you <em>do</em> have, and make the best use of them that you can.</li>
</ol>
<p>If, for instance, you have a hand injury, you could&nbsp;use&nbsp;it as an excuse to keep from training. Alternatively, you&nbsp;could&nbsp;look at it as a chance to analyze all of the elements of your martial arts style and see what can be made better. This may be just the opportunity you need to improve on your footwork or your kicks. Just because your upper body may not be at your full disposal, your lower body could become an amazing weapon that you can fine tune as you wait for your&nbsp;return to&nbsp;full strength.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes only a close tragedy produces the desire or motivation to pursue training in the martial arts. Our advice? Don't wait to learn self defense. Learn it now, while you can protect yourself and your loved ones.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An old saying goes, “Don&#8217;t wait until you need a drink to begin digging a well.” So why do people wait to learn to defend themselves until <em>after</em> they&#8217;ve been attacked?&nbsp;Or, they wait until they&#8217;ve heard about a home invasion in their neighborhood. Or, perhaps, a sexual assault story hits the news and stirs&nbsp;them&nbsp;to action. Don&#8217;t wait to learn self defense. Learn self defense now, while you can protect yourself and your loved ones.</p>
<p>Most people go through life with the attitudes such as: “I live in a safe community. Nothing like that would happen here. I don’t need to worry about becoming a victim of a violent crime.” While&nbsp;I don’t think we should live in a constant state of paranoia for&nbsp;our personal safety, we <em>do</em> need to be aware that anyone of us can become a victim. No one is exempt. No one ever thinks it will happen to them. We have to change our mindset.</p>
<p>For example, you could find yourself on a date that turns into a situation that gets physically or sexually violent. Normally, we don&#8217;t think about having to potentially defend ourselves from someone with whom we’d trust enough to go on a date or get in a car. Again, no one ever thinks it could happen to them. However, if that situation occurred, I&#8217;d want to have a solid arsenal of self-defense techniques at my fingertips. I wouldn&#8217;t want to wait until <em>after</em> I&#8217;d been assaulted to learn what I could have done to protect myself.</p>
<p>There is one simple thing we can do to keep ourselves from becoming victims, but many of us don&#8217;t do it!</p>
<h2>Be aware of your surroundings!</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t text on your phone as you walk, especially if you&#8217;re alone. Don&#8217;t sit in your car and text even if you&#8217;re parked. You&#8217;re a sitting duck to anyone who may have watched you walk to your car and knows you&#8217;re not paying attention to what is going on. Keep your head up. Be alert. Always be surveying the scene to see who and what is happening around you.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re going for a run, and you want to listen to music, only use one earbud. Allow, yourself the ability to hear the things going on around you with the other ear. You will be better able to hear footsteps or people talking which is especially important if someone was to try to sneak up on you.</li>
<li>Always try to use the buddy system. You are less likely to become a target for crime if you are with another person. An attacker is usually looking for a target who&nbsp;will be easy to overpower. Two or more people in a group make for a less easy target. Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask a trusted person to walk you to your car. It&#8217;s a much better choice than being attacked because you walked by yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, let&#8217;s say that you followed these general suggestions for being aware of your surroundings, but&nbsp;you are physically confronted by an attacker. Just being aware that there is someone who is trying to hurt you is no longer sufficient at this point. Now, you have to decide upon your course of action. You have two options:&nbsp;1) fight your attacker off, or 2) give in to your attacker because you don&#8217;t know what to do.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been trained to defend yourself, you&#8217;re much less likely to let someone take advantage of you. No one has the right to take anything from you! You have the right and responsibility to protect yourself from those who would try to physically harm you!</p>
<p>Learn to protect yourself and those you love. We recommend <a href="https://sifuochwingchun.com/marketing/wing-chun-kung-fu-classes/">Wing Chun training</a> as a practical, real-world solution. No one deserves or asks to be a victim of violence, but nonetheless it happens. Prepare yourself to protect yourself! The time to learn self-defense is well before you need to use it! Remember: “Don’t wait until you need a drink to begin digging a well!”</p>
