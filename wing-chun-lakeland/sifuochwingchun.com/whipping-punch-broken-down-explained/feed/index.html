					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] One of the main differences with Wing Chun, is that while in some instances also alternating between the left and right hand, it does not twist the body. Wing Chun keeps both hips forward allowing both hands to stay in range. When a punch is thrown the entire body lurches forward to give power to the strikes. You can also see this with the Wing Chun whipping punch. [&#8230;]]]></description>
