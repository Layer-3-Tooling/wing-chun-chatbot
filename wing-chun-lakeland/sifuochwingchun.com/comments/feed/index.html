					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] One of the main differences with Wing Chun, is that while in some instances also alternating between the left and right hand, it does not twist the body. Wing Chun keeps both hips forward allowing both hands to stay in range. When a punch is thrown the entire body lurches forward to give power to the strikes. You can also see this with the Wing Chun whipping punch. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Quick reactions are the cornerstone of Wing Chun self defense. It makes sense that, in one of the deadliest arts in the world, there is a specific drill to train your reaction. Drilling hours upon hours on good technique and structure is pointless if it cannot be applied in a combat scenario. Going back to what was mentioned earlier, that is why basic defense against attacks is introduced first at Sifu Och Wing Chun. Now that there is an appreciation for the techniques required, they can be upgraded. That is where Chi Sao lends a heavy hand to the Wing Chun practitioner&#8217;s development.
